007360305	NOW THERE'S A SPECIAL MAGICAL
007360374	WELL THEN I DO KNOW
007390013	BUT IT CERTAINLY IS POSSIBLE
007390019	THE WOLFS WERE NOT QUITE AS BAD
007390062	IT WAS A TOUGH POSITION TO BE IN
007390070	IT'S ABOUT WHAT KIND OF LIVES AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL LEAD
007390072	AND IT'S AGAINST THE LAW
007390092	IT SHOULD BE LOST OF RUN
007390119	NOTHING TO DO WITH HAVING A BABY
007390120	I HAVE NO TIME FOR GUESSING
007390139	IT'S MONDAY IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS
007390160	I'M MORE THAN WHAT THEM WANT TO BELIEVE
007390195	IT WALL DEPENDS ON WHAT IS IN OUR HEARTS
007390197	I SHAME TO BE THE ONLY ONE

007390211	LOST AN HOUR OF SLEEP
007390220	NOTHING WILL KEEP ME AWAY FROM THIS MUSIC
007390228	DO WE NEED TO SAY EVERYTHING
007390238	TIME TO PUT YOUR MIND THE TEST
007390281	IT'S A VERY AMERICAN VIEW
007390294	BEAT THE TIGER FOR US
007390355	BUT WE MUST SPEAK FURTHER OF IN HIS SONGS
007650036	HOWEVER MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE LEFT US WITH NO OTHER CHOICE
007650061	NEARLY ALL REPUBLICANS VOTED AGAINST THE MEASURE
007650076	I CAN UNDERSTAND HIS DESIRE TO GET ANOTHER OPINION
007650078	A YEAR LATER THE PLANT WAS CLOSED
007650084	DEFINE YOUR OWN ROLE IN A SITUATION
007650089	BUT HE IS EXPECTED TO BE FULL STRENGTH HIS WEEK
007650116	MONEY IS THE REASON FOR SUCCESS
007650131	I LEARNED A LOT DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS
007650174	MISSING YOU USED TO BE EASY
007650181	I MAY NOT BE ALL THAT TO YOU
007650192	SO IT'S THAT KIND OF PARTY
007650197	WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE BACK
007650254	EVERYTHING IS IN GOD'S WORD
007650271	SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD CHALLENGE
007650294	YOU NEED TO MAKE A TRIP HERE
007650337	I SEE THAT NOW IT IS TOO NIGHT
007650346	HOLDING THE CUTS CLOSE CLOSED
007650352	I PUT THE GUN DOWN
007650369	I SHALL BE AT HAND FOR THE TRIAL
007650377	SOME THERE ARE WHO CAN SEE AND GO FORTH
008110043	AND STATES HAVE NOT HAD MUCH TIME
008110049	WE FEEL THE PUBLIC IS BEING USED
008110106	WE SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE CONFIDENCE
008110107	I WAS TURNED AROUND TO GET THE PLANE THAT FIRED
008110110	GUNS WERE USED FOR ABOUT THREE OF EVERY FIVE KILLINGS
008110113	THAT'S THE WAY I WANT TO BE
008110116	IT WAS NOTHING SHORT OF MAGIC
008110147	CAN WE JUST GET BACK TO THE ADS PLEASE
008110159	LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS
008110175	I WANT TO GO BAD

008110247	EVEN THEN HE WANT TO WIN
008110258	SMILE TO COVER UP THE PAIN
008110286	EVERYTHING IS STARTING TO FALL INTO PLACE PERFECTLY
008110287	SORRY NOT A FAN OF THAT DECISION
008110307	THERE WAS A GENTLE KNOCK ON THE DOOR
008110340	BUT THE EYES WERE STRIKING
008110371	YOU HAVE ONLY TO GO ON
008130061	IT WAS JUST LIKE A SPRING TRAINING PLAY
008130081	THE JAZZ WERE UNABLE TO GET OFF A FINAL SHOT
008130091	THREE OF THE VICTIMS WERE LISTED IN SERIOUS CONDITION
008130100	BUT I WOULD IF HE WERE THE BEST PLAYER
008130153	LOVE IS IN THE BUILDING
008130196	I JUST WANT TO BE THERE
008130222	YOU DIG HELP MAKE IT HAPPEN
008130233	WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP IT
008130257	BUT IT IS GOOD ALONE
008130271	WE WILL HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE
008130281	ESPECIALLY AFTER A LONG SESSION
008130282	I'M SO LUCKY TO LIVE IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PLACE
008130283	LITTLE TOO MUCH TIME ON MY HANDS TODAY
008130288	THINGS ARE ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE FROM HERE
008130301	BUT HE WANTS TO COME SOONER
008130339	THE GIRL WAS FOUR AT THE TIME
008130340	OH IT IS RICH TO SEE AND HEAR HER
008130346	IT WAS A SUFFICIENT ANSWER
008130356	AND THEN HE WILL TAKE IT
008130380	I BEG TO KNOW IF SUCH WERE THE FACT
009600062	THE GAME IS FILLED WITH THIS
009600113	HE'S UP AGAINST SOMETHING THAT IS NOT GOING TO YIELD
009600118	IS IT POSSIBLE YOU ARE IN THE WRONG ACCOUNT
009600120	JUST A PIECE OF TODAY
009600127	THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO SEE TODAY
009600129	NEED TO INVEST IN YOUR FUTURE
009600133	BUT WERE DEPENDENCE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GAME
009600140	IT'S GOOD TO BE THE CAPTAIN
009600186	FEEL FOR HIS WIFE AND SONGS
009600190	ONCE YOU LOSE THE PASSION IT IS A WRAP
009600205	IS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE TENNIS TOMORROW
009600215	DAY ONE IN THE BAG
009600262	IT'S GOOD TO BE WHITE
009600267	YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW WRONG YOU ARE
009600270	THINKING OF HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS
009600287	I KNOW I AM GOING TO BED
009600335	AND THIS IS MY OPINION AND IT'S A FINAL ONE
009600337	I MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE HERE
009600338	THE NEXT STOP WAS AT THE MUSEUM
009600343	WHAT A DAY FOR A BATHE
009810029	HUMAN ERROR CAN ALSO BE A FACTOR
009810073	BUT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
009810075	I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY PHYSICAL GAME
009810106	HE COULD SING ANY PART IN A SONG
009810112	IT MAKES YOU WANT TO EAT THE CAKE
009810153	NOW IT FEELS LIKE HOME
009810155	AND ALL YOU CAN DO IS ENOUGH
009810196	HE WILL RANK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
009810200	IT'S A BOTTLE OF WATER
009810204	ASH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO RETURN TO WORK AFTER LUNCH
009810230	GREAT THAT YOU ARE SO NICE TO YOUR FANS

009810283	SO GLAD TO HAVE A GOOD MAN NOW
009810293	BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
009810305	NO HE'S GOING ON STRAIGHT
009810327	HE MOTIONED THE TO THE YARD
009810344	THIS IS NOT THE TREASURE
009810349	I THOUGHT YOU WERE MARRIED
010120008	IT'S SOMETHING TO WATCH FOR
010120059	HE ALLOWED FIVE WRONGS AND EIGHT HITS OVER FIVE INNINGS
010120071	I WAS ALL OVER HIM IN THE SECOND SET
010120128	HE'S A DOCTOR OF EVERYTHING
010120148	I HAVE A FEELING THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
010120166	I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO BE
010120180	I GO WITH THE FOLLOW

010120212	NOT IN THE MOOD OF ANY OF THEM
010120219	DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE CONFIRMED
010120243	IT'S BASED OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND MY COUSIN
010120255	HE TRYING TO GET BACK IN THE HOUSE
010120265	IRON BANNER CONTROL IS BACK
010120269	SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME ON A GAME
010120303	DOING THE LITTLE THINGS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
010120334	I HAD JUST COME IN FROM THE STREET
010120335	IT WAS SO WELL PRINTED ON SUCH GOOD PAPER
010120374	THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO SAY
010270117	YELL THE VERY SAME THING

010270265	THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM

020590026	LIGHTING A FIRE IS AN EASY WAY TO GET FOUND
020590047	AT LEAST NOT FOR NOW
020590077	I WAS PROBABLY FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF MORE THAN ANYTHING
020590103	THAT'S A LOT MORE COMPLICATED

020610010	I LOST BY ONE VOTE
020610014	SHE WAS AMONG THE DEAD
020610061	PLANS WERE BEING MADE FOR A MEMORIAL SERVICE
020610090	THEY BEAT US ON THE FIELD
020610122	THIS IS A NATURAL PART OF LIFE
020610134	MAYBE I WILL BE SAFE
020610166	TOGETHER WE WILL DO THIS
020610168	DECIDE TO LIVE IN A BEAUTIFUL STATE
020610174	HOPE IT'S JUST A EUROPE ISSUE
020610175	WHAT ARE YOU HOPING TO GAIN
020610194	YES IT WAS AN INTERESTING HOUSE
020610201	THANK YOU FOR THE ASSIST
020610206	NOT THAT KIND OF STORY
020610207	WAS IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE
020610291	DO YOU HAVE A BATHROOM
020610302	QUESTION IS WHERE DO YOU LAND
020610316	IT WAS ABOUT THAT PLAN OF ESCAPE
020610328	HE TAPPED ON THE GLASS
020610341	THEY USED TO BEAT US TO STEAL OUR BRUSHES
020610343	I REMEMBER THAT SOME BUT STILL NOTHING OF HER
020890003	IT WAS SOMETHING THAT NEVER HAPPENED TO US BEFORE
020890037	IT'S STILL THERE FOR ME
020890112	BUT THOSE ARE NOT MY DECISIONS
020890134	SHOULD BE A WAKE UP CALL
020890156	WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT DREAMS
020890165	AS PART OF THE RUN UP TO RELEASE
020890206	TRUST ME THERE IS PLENTY OF BREAD
020890207	OFTEN NOT SO EASY TO DO
020890215	UNTIL YOU SIT AND LISTEN TO IT
020890219	DO YOU HAVE THE GLASSES
020890259	GLAD YOU ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME
020890260	WINDOWS OPEN TRANSFORMERS IN BED
020890267	BEST TWO MONTHS OF THE YEAR
020890274	I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE SO EASY TO DRAW
020890306	THERE WERE TWO NEW LIVES IN THE HOUSE
020890313	BUT HE WOULD NOT LET ME GO
020890326	PREDICTION IS AS CLEAR AS DAY IS IT NOT
020890340	GO AND GET READY IF YOU WANT TO COME
020890346	WHAT WAS SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS SONG
020890371	I KNOW WHO THEY ARE
021120025	THAT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM
021120059	WE WANT OUR TEAMS TO REMAIN WHERE THEY ARE
021120074	AM I EVEN CLOSE TO WHERE I WANT TO BE
021120075	THIS IS JUST THE WAY I FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE WORKING
021120085	I KNOW THAT WILL HAPPEN
021120108	AND WE BOTH HAVE PLAYERS WHO CAN RUN AND JUMP
021120135	REMEMBER THE CHARITY STREAM IS TOMORROW
021120151	I WOULD LOVE TO FORGET

021120232	ALWAYS PUT EVERYTHING ON THE LINE
021120233	WHAT DO YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT
021120250	LESS GOVERNMENT NOT MORE IS THE SOLUTION
021120256	ONLY WAY TO HAVE A FRIEND IS TO BE ONE
021120296	THAT THING HAD A LOT OF TIRES
021120309	THE FATHER OF HER CHILD WAS NOT EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
021120321	WHAT IF BUSINESS MAN SHOULD ACT IN THIS MANNER
021120354	KILLING'S NOT PART OF IT
021160002	HE WOULD NOT SAY IF THERE WERE SUSPECTS
021160027	THAT'S WHAT WE THINK THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
021160075	I THINK EVERYONE ACROSS THE BOARD IS SAD
021160080	WE NEED TO DO BETTER
021160089	HOW DO YOU GET A REPORTER IN TO COVER THAT
021160090	POLICE RESPONDED WITH TEAR GAS
021160120	GOING TO COME BACK AND TRY TO CLEAN UP SOMETHING
021160134	DREAM IT SEE IT AND BE IT
021160185	HOW CAN IT BE SEPTEMBER ALREADY
021160188	WHAT IS THIS A JOKE
021160195	MAY YOU MUST BE SMOKING
021160198	WE NEED MORE AND MORE AND MORE
021160203	BEST RIGHT BACK IN THE WORLD
021160207	JUST GIVE THEM A CHANCE

021290144	MENTALLY READY FOR A FULL DAY OF TRAVEL
021290148	IT'S WAY TOO MUCH FOR ME ALREADY

021290169	DRIVING TO THE MOON IN STYLE
021290173	ALL THE BEST FOR THE MOVIE
021290200	PLEASE GO BACK TO THE STARS SYSTEM

021290326	I NEVER TO SEE THEM AGAIN
021290371	FEAR MUST HAVE TURNED MY HEAD
021680007	I HAD HOPED TO DO BETTER
021680016	NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS A CROSS THERE
021680048	HE WILL BE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE IN BOTH AREAS

021680122	I WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE WITH YOU
021680154	INTERESTED TO GET YOUR TAKE
021680169	I WILL BE AT WORK TOMORROW
021680190	FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION SUCCESS IS JUST A PROCESS
021680237	ANY REPORTS ON THE CONTENTS OF THE PIE
021680246	MAN PILLAR IS THE BEST
021680249	FACTS ARE OF NO IMPORTANCE TO THEM
021680251	MAYBE IT'S THE SAME MENU
021680266	LOVE COMING TO THE BRAVES GAME
021680288	UNLUCKY NOT TO GO ON AND WIN THE GAME TODAY
021680297	WE HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE FINDING YOU
021680318	OH HE'S A NICE MAN IS YOUR FATHER
021680332	THAT WAS WHY WE SHIFTED
021680369	HERE IT IS YOU SEE SIR
021680379	HENCE THE CYCLE OF THE GAMES IS BRIEF
021680380	I TURNED AND THE FRENCH WINDOW WAS OPEN BEHIND ME
021700029	A LOT OF PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT ROLE
021700034	BUT THE SITUATION WAS ALSO UNCOMFORTABLE
021700062	THE TEARS WERE JUST RUNNING OUT OF MY EYES
021700077	FOR HER IT'S PRAISE
021700120	YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
021700131	I WAS TRYING TO FORGET
021700139	I GET SOME OF THE CRITICISM
021700153	THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE BEST MOVIE EVER
021700176	I DO IT FOR US
021700211	WHICH WAS A STUPID THING TO DO
021700224	MAJORITY OF THE DAY WITH MY LOVE

021700291	THAT WAS A GREAT CHAPTER
021700300	ALL I CAN DO IS SIT BACK AND LAUGH
021700362	AND THE ANSWER IS YES
021700379	MARK IS A BAD CORRESPONDENT
021790008	JIM WENT TO SEE KANGAROO

021790169	HE WOULD GO OUT BUT WHEN
021790173	YOU HAVE NO IDEAS HAVE YOU
022080028	I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY SIMPLE
022080038	I THINK THE KEY WORD IS PROBABLY
022080085	THERE WAS NO RECORD OF ADOPTION
022080100	I WANT TO WIN IT VERY MUCH
022080116	NOT THE SAME BUT IT IS DELICIOUS

022080189	AND THERE IS NO ANSWER
022080192	WE WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE GAME
022080202	TIGERS ARE ON THE BOARD
022080204	UNTIL THEN YOU ARE BLOCKED
022080210	ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT
022080294	AND WHO IS THE JUDGE
022080299	I'D LOVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT ONE
022080340	BECAUSE WHY WOULD ANYBODY CHOOSE TO BE UNHAPPY
022080341	HIS FIRST BOW TO THE PUBLIC
022360092	SO THAT IS PROBABLY AN UPPER LIMIT
022360126	THE ONLY THING HAVE TO PAY IS ATTENTION
022360147	YOU ALL IN MY PRAYERS
022360159	ARE YOU NOT GOING TO TOUR
022360185	WHAT A GREAT FRIDAY EVENING
022360186	GLAD YOU LIKE THE SONG
022360221	THIS WOULD BE MY LAST WISH
022360222	PARKING WOULD SEEM TO ISSUE

022360265	AND WHAT WILL YOU DO TO GET THERE
022360293	I WAS SO PROUD OF MYSELF
022360310	HER MOTHER WHO HAD MADE HER WAS NO HUMAN
022360311	COME TO THE HOUSE AND STAY
022360321	THERE'S NOTHING THAT UNUSUAL ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN
022360326	WILL FIND THIS OUT SOME DAY
022360350	I WILL GO AND LOOK FOR IT
022420015	IT MADE ME FEEL GOOD
022420045	ONLY THE BOATS ARE ARMED LIGHTLY
022420067	IT'S NOT GOING TO KILL THEM
022420073	YET ALL IT TAKES IS THREE TWO ONE
022420086	SATURDAY WINNING COLORS WILL BECOME THE SECOND
022420106	EVERYONE CAN WIN AT HOME
022420129	STILL ONE OF MY FEARS
022420138	IF YOU NEED A REMINDER
022420146	THE SPRING MARKET IS STRONG
022420164	SURE IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE
022420168	IT'S NICE TO GET BACK INTO IT AGAIN
022420172	BLUE WAS READY TO GO
022420273	HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON WITH YOUR BIKE
022420288	WE HAVE TO MAKE A STAND NOW
022420292	MY HOME IS IN THE STARS
022420306	IT IS MY LOVE THAT IS BOLD
022420342	WAS HE NOT HAPPY TOO
022420346	WE NEITHER OF US KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT
022420348	THERE WAS ALWAYS A DAY WHEN SHE CALLED TIME
022420362	THEY BOTH LAUGHED AND FOR A LONG TIME
022440038	INSURANCE IS A MAJOR CONSIDERATION IN MOVING
022440039	HE KNOWS BETTER THAN TO TELL ME ABOUT THOSE THINGS
022440062	AFTER THAT COMES THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD
022440073	THE DANGERS OF HANGING OUT IN PUBLIC PLACES
022440126	SO YOU SHOULD BE FINE
022440134	THEY HAVE HAD THEIR CHANCE FOR MONTHS
022440139	POP IT ON THE LIST
022440144	SO YOU KNOW THE USUAL
022440165	SEEING YOU LIKE THIS IS NOT PRETTY
022440180	NOTHING BETTER THAN A DAY AT THE BEACH
022440189	IT'S UP TO YOU TO MAKE SURE THEY NEVER FORGET
022440215	YOU WILL BE THERE IN SPIRIT
022440277	PLEASE KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME
022440286	WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET A HOLD OF YOU
022440312	IT'S AS STEADY AS A ROCK
022440337	WHEN SHE LOOKED UP SHE BEAMED
022440340	THE TRAIL THOUGH WOULD BE EXTENSIVE
022440352	A THOUSAND YEARS AGO IT SEEMED
022440361	BUT ONLY IF SHE COULD HANDLE THE HEAT
022440362	AS IF SHE WANTED HIM TO LEAVE
022510066	BUT WE WOULD ASK MORE OF YOU
022510069	THAT'S WHY IT IS SO DIFFICULT
022510089	BUT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
022510093	WE MIGHT GET BEAT AND WE MIGHT WIN
022510095	THEY ALL LIVED IN THE SAME STREET
022510122	YOU KNOW THIS COULD BE TRUE
022510152	TAG A FRIEND YOU WISH YOU WERE HERE WITH
022510166	FASHION IS IN A TERRIBLE STATE
022510190	IT'S A BIT OF A FEAR FOR ME THAT
022510211	HOW ABOUT THIS FOR A CHANGE
022510230	THAT WAY PEOPLE WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT LIVE
022510237	I THINK WE SHOULD GET HIM ON THE SHOW
022510255	I MAY STILL BE TIRED
022510266	VIDEO ABOUT THE NEW LOCATION
022510276	REMEMBER THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL
022510291	MATCH OF THE YEAR SO FAR
022510300	I THINK IT IS TIME
022510320	KEEPING MY HAND IN MY POCKET
022510323	SHE WANTS TO GET CAUGHT
022510368	BUT HOW MANY WILL NEVER SEE IT
022520012	I LOST MY JACKET IN THE SECOND GAME
022520036	BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS WAS
022520067	WHO ELSE WOULD YOU WANT OUT THERE
022520159	THIS IS GOOD FOR US
022520174	THERE ARE THINGS IN LIFE THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
022520200	EVEN YOU CAN SEE THAT
022520203	RUNNING ON THE STREETS NOT SO MUCH
022520209	HAPPINESS IS NOT A GOAL BUT A WAY OF LIFE
022520221	HAPPY TO BE YOUR HELP
022520225	WHAT IS THE WORST ONE
022520226	ACTUALLY WE ARE STILL HAVING
022520258	LIVE IN HALF AN HOUR FOR OUR STREAM
022520272	CREATED THE WORLD YOU WANT TO LIVE IN
022520290	SURELY YOU HAVE THE ANSWER RIGHT
022520337	IN ABOUT THE THIRD ROW
022520345	REMEMBER THE TIME YOU WERE HUNGRY
022520358	HER MOTHER HER MOUTH WAS VERY CLOSE TO HIS MOUTH
022520360	SHE COULD GO IN OR SHE COULD GO AWAY
022520366	THESE PEOPLES ARE MY PEOPLES TOO YOU KNOW
022520375	AND YOU CANNOT EVEN JOIN
022820020	THE MAN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HAD A BROWN JACKET
022820021	SOME WORKERS WERE BACK ON THE JOB
022820026	THEY WOULD NOT STAND FOR IT
022820042	SOMEBODY WHO CAN HIT HOME RUNS AND DRIVE IN RUNS
022820062	HE PROBABLY IS THE MOST TALENTED IN THE SECONDARY
022820072	IF THERE WERE GAMES WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM THEM
022820079	I WAS WATCHING BACK AND FIRTH BACK AND FIRTH
022820106	MANY OF THE TROOPS WERE BADLY BURNED
022820107	I JUST WANTED TO PLAY STEADY
022820121	ANIMAL KINGDOM DAY AND NIGHT
022820134	WHAT A GREAT SUNDAY MORNING
022820142	THEY HAD A GOOD SEASON
022820155	QUICK CHANGE HOW DO YOU DO IT
022820191	GOING TO TRY AND MAKE IT
022820197	FIRST GAME DAY OF THE YEAR
022820281	WE ARE IN THE BACK
022820291	I READ A LOT OF FICTION
022820293	EDGE OF TOMORROW IS GOOD TIME
022820317	WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS LATER
022820357	HERE'S THE GREAT MAN HIMSELF
023270032	IT WAS NOT A CONSCIOUS DECISION
023270080	SO IT WAS VERY HELPFUL
023270098	I WANTED HIM TO DO IT HERE
023270118	TIME TO GET THE SECOND ONE
023270120	NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO THERE YOU ARE
023270140	I MADE UP MY MIND A LONG TIME AGO
023270148	MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THE PRESENT
023270161	LET GOD TAKE CARE OF THE REST
023270171	ACTUALLY I HAVE TO RUN
023270214	MY SAINTS HAVE TO BE BETTER
023270237	IF YOU ARE BLAMING YOU ARE NOT BEING GRATEFUL
023270268	LOTS OF BLUE AND WHITE TODAY
023270280	ABOUT TO BE A LONG DAY
023270286	ALL OF US HAVE RIGHT
023270303	TIME FOR ME TO MAKE SOME DECISION
023270315	SHE FOLLOWED HIM WITH HER EYES
023270319	I WANT YOUR GOOD NOTHING SO MUCH AS THAT
023270321	SHE TOUCHED HIM ON THE CHECK WITH HER LIPS
023270331	BUT THEY HAD NO CHANCE TO FLY YET
023270364	I WANT TO DO SOMETHING GOOD WITH IT
023550002	THAT'S THE MINIMUM THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO ME PERSONALLY
023550003	SPEAKER AFTER SPEAKER CALLED FOR AN END TO MILITARY RULE
023550008	I GET ALL MY MONEY FROM ABROAD
023550013	I DO WHAT I THINK IS FUNNY
023550099	BEFORE THEY GET DOWN TO ZERO
023550123	TODAY IS GOING TO BE A BUSY DAY
023550138	EDITOR AT FAN OF ROCK
023550167	THEY HAD A BIG TIME
023550175	OLD PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DRIVE
023550201	THE MOST POWERFUL THING YOU CAN DO IS RECOVER
023550202	TODAY WAS THE START OF A REVOLUTION
023550230	ANGER IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO CONTROL
023550233	CHILL DOWN WITH THE TALENT
023550237	NOTE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THIS THING
023550257	ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE A BRITISH PREMIERE
023550260	I THOUGHT IT'S WAS A FUN FACT
023550290	UNABLE TO CATCH THE JETS GAME
023550310	AT LEAST IT WILL BE THIS TERM
023550319	BUT I KNOW WHAT I MEAN
023550341	BUT SUCH ARE THE MILITARY
023800015	I AM SO SORRY TO ALL OF YOU
023800042	THE OTHERS WERE TREATED IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM
023800056	HE MAY HAVE ALREADY STARTED
023800093	THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO APPROACH IT I THINK
023800114	HE SHOULD HAVE LET THE ORGANIZATION AND THE MANAGER KNOW
023800124	WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW THEY ARE SPECIAL
023800160	GOING TO ANY OTHER GAMES
023800186	I MADE IT TO THE FINALE
023800242	CERTAINLY YOU CAN BE MORE SPECIFIC
023800260	HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU SPEND DOING
023800277	BUT NO NEED FOR THAT NOW
023800278	I WAS ABLE TO DEFEND AGAINST IT SUCCESSFULLY
023800280	HOPE SHE HAD A GOOD DAY MATE
023800298	PLANTS GROW TO THE SIZE OF THE POT
023800326	THAT KID HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
023800330	IT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
023800338	THIS IS NO FANCY SKETCH BUT THE TRUTH
023800352	SHE WAS LARGE AND SHE WAS KIND
023800363	THUS FAR THEREFORE ALL WAS WELL
023800368	THE HOUSE WAS VERY STILL
024020047	ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK
024020051	AS OF MONDAY MORNING THE POST IS STILL UP
024020053	THAT'S A LONG WAY TO RUN
024020069	THERE WAS NO REQUEST MADE FOR THE GUARD TODAY
024020084	HE'S HONEST TO BE THE BONE
024020142	INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE EVENTS I PRODUCE
024020158	WELL TIME FOR ME TO GO TO SLEEP
024020175	ALCOHOL IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER
024020176	PUMPED FOR THE RETURN OF THE KING TODAY
024020205	IT SHOULD BE A GOOD NIGHT
024020233	SO THIS SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY BIG DEAL
024020238	SEE ALL I HAD TO DO WAS COMPLAIN
024020253	SPIRITUAL FORMATION IS NOT SOMETHING WE MASTER
024020256	WINNING IS SO MUCH FUN
024020260	BLESS SUGAR RAY AND HIS FAMILY
024020265	HANGING OUT AT THE BEACH
024020291	THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE UNIVERSE
024020321	IT IS NOW TWO O'CLOCK
024020328	HE WAS TWENTY WHEN HE LEARNED THE TRUTH ABOUT HIMSELF
024020337	I WISH YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THESE TWO LETTERS
024270011	MORE SNOW WAS IN THE FORECAST FOR MONDAY NIGHT
024270019	IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT NECESSARY
024270028	TODAY THEY ARE MORE DYNAMIC AND MORE HUMANE
024270051	OTHERS ARE NOT QUITE SO SURE HOWEVER
024270053	THEY ARE SO DEEP IN TALENT
024270057	EACH TEAM STARTS AT THE SAME TIME
024270077	BUT I SAW IT AGAIN
024270127	WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOCCER
024270155	BACK AND AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME
024270168	WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE ARE
024270176	STILL WAITING FOR IT TO HAPPEN
024270178	LOOKS TO BE WORTH THE WAIT
024270183	FEELS SO GOOD TO BE BACK TOGETHER
024270197	LISTEN TO IT IN ALL ITS GLORY
024270206	MASKS ARE PART OF UNIFORM
024270245	WHEN IS IT TIME TO TALK ABOUT GUNS
024270270	THIS IS NOT A NICE STORY IT'S TRUE
024270292	WE SHOULD TOTALLY GO FOR A WALK
024270313	BUT THEY MUST DO IT
024270336	AND NOW IT'S MY TURN
024300001	THERE MAY BE A WAY TO CHANGE ALL THAT
024300052	NOW HE'S OPEN HE CAN SELL IT TO YOU
024300061	IT WAS A NEW MARKET
024300063	COULD YOU PUT HIM ON THE BOARD
024300065	HE WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE PARTY THERE
024300068	SO THEY HAVE TO GO WITH MORE SOPHISTICATE POSITIONING
024300080	BUT IS NOT NOW
024300082	NOW BECAUSE OF DRAGONS LOOK WHERE HE IS TODAY
024300093	THERE IS ALWAYS THE QUESTION OF WHAT WILL FOLLOW
024300099	THE ECONOMY IS FAR FROM SOUND
024300118	KEEP IN TOUCH HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND
024300131	I MEAN IT WAS THE LAST SUPPER
024300132	WELL THANKS FOR THE CONSIDERATION
024300135	HE ALWAYS KNOWS HOW TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER
024300189	IT'S WEDNESDAY YOU KNOW THE DRILL
024300221	ENOUGH OF THE TIME LOOP
024300270	IT IS SUCH A GOOD FIRM
024300330	AT FIRST HE COULD NOT SPEAK
024300345	AND NOW I GO DOWN TO LOOK AT IT
024300360	SHE WAS BROAD AT THIS SHOULDERS
024380040	THERE'S TOO MUCH A STAKE TO DO OTHERWISE
024380041	IT'S HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE
024380116	PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW I CAN BE OF SERVICE
024380142	PARADISE MAY BE AROUND THE CORNER
024380154	CALL ME IF YOU DO
024380194	ROLL UP TO THE PARTY LIKE
024380197	USED TO BE AN OLD SCHOOL I THINK
024380200	I NEED TO KEEP UP WITH THINGS BETTER
024380204	SHE WAS THERE FOR A CONCERT
024380234	TAKE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY
024380247	AT THE COST OF WHAT
024380265	THAT'S A BUCKET LIST GOAL
024380276	SO GIVE ME SOMETHING TO BELIEVE
024380278	HAPPY BIRTHDAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR ALL YOU DO
024380315	IT WAS TIGHT FIT
024380317	AND THEN BY HIS GRAVE HIS EYES OPENED
024380325	THEN YOU MUST MAKE SOUP OUT OF THE SNAKES
024380354	THAT'S THE BEST GAME ALWAYS
024380363	I WAS NOT LEFT DRIFTING
024380369	HAD IT HAPPENED ON PURPOSE
024410049	I APOLOGIZE TO THE COURT
024410052	NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE IS THE PLAN WILL WORK
024410092	I THINK HE CAN LEAD US TO VICTORY AGAINST ANYBODY
024410098	HE IS ALSO AMONG THOSE TRYING TO LEARN HOW
024410110	HE WOULD REACH BACK AND GET A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA
024410149	WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY STATUE
024410158	SOCIAL AND DOWN TO EARTH
024410160	FINISHED RISE OF THE LAST NIGHT
024410173	WONDER WHAT HE THINKS WE SHOULD DO WITH HIM
024410222	OR IT IS JUST ME AND WHO CARES
024410228	I KIND OF LIKE THIS SNOWSTORM
024410240	SO MUCH TO DO TOMORROW
024410241	WHY DO YOU WANT TO REPLACE HIM
024410294	IT'S PART OF THE SERIES
024410312	COLLEGE IS ALL ABOUT SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR THE FUTURE
024410318	LET HER HAVE HER OWN WAY FOR THE MOMENT
024410322	AND FOR THIS HE IS PUT TO SHAME
024410350	AND AS SUCH YOU NEED HELP
024410368	THE MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME IS NOT FAR TO SEEK
024410377	WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR EYES
024480016	BUT THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE OFFICIAL COMMENT
024480028	I LOVED HER WITH ALL MY HEART
024480094	WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT
024480095	THURSDAY IS THE LAST DAY OF THIS YEAR'S DEBATE
024480105	BUT IT MIGHT BE ALL ABOUT THE PHYSICAL PLAY
024480127	WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO AN INTERVIEW
024480159	IT IS A FORM OF SELFISHNESS
024480186	JUST TO HEAR HIS VOICE
024480188	HOPING THAT THEY ARE DOING THE SAME WITH THIS ONE
024480212	WHAT ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE UNIVERSE
024480228	SO IN NEED OF A GOOD MOVIE
024480232	SOMETIMES THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS NOTHING
024480241	HE WAS TRYING TO KEEP YOU SAFE
024480244	LEARN THE WHY NOT JUST THE WHAT
024480251	IT'S NICE TO HAVE A BREAK
024480255	THEN IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING NEW
024480270	HAD A NICE DAY AT THE ZOO
024480292	LEARN TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE PRESSURE
024480297	I BELIEVE IN YOU YOU CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN
024480335	ARE YOU COMING TO BED
024500006	THREE AND FOUR ARE THE BEST
024500021	HE AND HIS PARENTS SAY THEY ARE NO LONGER SPEAKING
024500033	ENOUGH OF THE TECHNICAL STUFF
024500095	WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A TOUGH RACE TRACK
024500126	YOU MUST HAVE A LOT
024500139	BUT I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE
024500141	THIS WOULD BE A VERY BUSY DAY
024500147	I COME FROM A FAMILY OF TEACHERS
024500151	SORRY FOR BEING A PLASTIC
024500156	WHAT DO YOU SAY THE MOST
024500164	WHAT AND HOW DO YOU SING
024500228	WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO BE READY TO PLAY
024500250	DO YOU LIKE THE COLOR OF THE SKY
024500268	WHY IN THE WORLD AM I NOT IN THE BED
024500284	IT'S SUNDAY NIGHT NOT THE END OF THE WORLD
024500317	AND IN A SENSE YOU WERE RIGHT
024500327	AND IT IS MY OWN HAND
024500333	AS FOR THE FINAL THREE
024500350	HE STARED AT THE STUDENTS
024500363	THERE'S NOTHING TO DO BUT GET DRUNK
024510017	IT WAS TOUGH FOR US AT THE TIME
024510043	IT'S VERY MUCH PART OF MY INTIMATE LIFE
024510061	IT'S TOO PRECIOUS TO US TO LET IT DIE
024510070	IT'S ALL PART AND PARCEL OF NEW MANAGEMENT STYLE
024510114	TROOPS MOVE IN TO BREAK UP SOME STRIKES
024510164	WHERE IN SOUTH AFRICA ARE YOU FROM
024510179	GOD I LOVE THIS MAN ALREADY
024510195	SO GRATEFUL TO BE A PART OF THIS
024510206	GOOD PEOPLE COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT
024510215	JUST CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF MYSELF IN THE MIRROR
024510224	TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE YOU MUST BE THE DIFFERENCE
024510247	BE THE MIRACLE YOU WANT TO SEE IN THE WORLD
024510252	SOMEONE WANT TO GO TO WORK FOR ME
024510275	OR DO YOU WANT ME TO
024510316	ONE LOOK WILL BE SUFFICIENT
024510323	NO ANGEL WOULD DO SUCH A THING
024510336	HUMANE DOCTORS MOST OF THEM
024510351	THE PROFESSOR TURNED DOWN THE SHEETS
024510352	THIS WAS THE GIRL HE HAD HAD DOUBTS OF
024510375	IT WAS A SMALL ROOM
024880041	THEY TALK ABOUT THE MOUNTAINS
024880059	EVERYTHING IS STILL AHEAD OF ME
024880070	HE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWER
024880098	THEY GET USED TO THE HEAT
024880118	LET'S MAKE SURE THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
024880155	WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU MAKE IT UP HERE
024880176	BECAUSE IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO
024880190	BUT STILL NO IDEA WANT WHAT TO ASK
024880194	SO PLEASE FEEL FREE TO LET US KNOW
024880195	WHERE DO YOU THINK IS A GOOD FIT
024880207	I REALLY NEED TO DO BETTER
024880210	HE HAD TO GET OUT OF THE CARE CAR
024880234	INSTEAD YOU GIVE ME SUN
024880245	I DO NOT WANT TO PLAY THIS
024880258	DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THE THINGS YOU SAY
024880267	THANK YOU FOR THE POST
024880269	WELL ALL TIME TO CALL IT A NIGHT
024880299	THIS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE BEST MOVIE EVER
024880303	AND IT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME
024880339	I WAS TRYING TO GUESS THE TIME
025380004	THERE WERE HATS BUTTONS AND RED WHITE AND BLUE BALLOONS
025380051	SHE WILL FIGHT AND WE ARE READY
025380065	I WANTED THIS TO END
025380091	IT IS AN INNER INTERNATIONAL WORD
025380107	HE WAS REPORTED IN GUARDED CONDITION TODAY
025380133	ADVICE AS FAR AS WHAT
025380149	WORK IS NOT ALL THAT TO LIFE
025380151	YES AND THE DEADLY ONE TOO
025380152	MEANWHILE IS IT PIG ROAST YET
025380158	PUTTING ALL OF US AT RISK OF A NUCLEAR WAR
025380162	BUT THERE WAS NO PROTEST
025380175	EVERYBODY IS GETTING READY FOR THEIR PITCH
025380202	SHOW THE PAY RICE VIDEO
025380217	WELL THAT WAS JUST RIDICULOUS
025380251	OR THE ONE WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHERS
025380256	I HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT'S POPULAR
025380277	YES IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE
025380298	HOPE YOU ALL HAD A GOOD WEEKEND
025380340	HE HAD A MOMENT OF DOUBT
025380347	THEY ENTERED THROUGH THE OPENING ON THE BEACH
026210005	THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL
026210047	YOU TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT THOSE KIND OF THINGS
026210096	IT'S A VICTORY LAP FOR ME
026210123	JUST WONDERING WHAT TO DO WITH THE CAT
026210132	AND WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED SO FAR
026210135	COULD NOT BE SO PROUD
026210136	LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT
026210141	LOT MORE TO LIFE THAN FOOTBALL
026210157	HI ANGEL YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
026210177	WAIT YOU CAN SEE THAT CAN YOU
026210185	HOPELESSNESS IS A GREAT SIGH
026210203	IT WAS SO GREAT TO SEE EVERYONE
026210213	THEY TALK A LOT OF SENSE
026210220	IT'S NOT AS SWEET WHEN YOU HAVE TO SHARE
026210231	A LIGHT IN THE SHADOW
026210242	HOPE TO SEE MUCH MORE OF YOU
026210262	GREAT FIRST GAME OF THE SEASON
026210287	IT USED TO BE CALLED A HAPPY ENDING
026210299	AND I GET TO HEAR A LOT OF IT
026210302	IT WAS A GREAT FUN
027400077	I THINK WE NEED THAT TYPE OF PERSON
027400094	ASK THEM IF THEY PLAN TO VOTE
027400125	IT'S A GAME OF CHEESE BABY
027400126	IT IS MUCH MORE THAN THIS
027400145	ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS EXECUTE
027400146	THANK YOU SO MUCH TO YOU AND THE TEAM
027400151	HAVE YOU SET A DATE FOR YOUR VIDEO YET
027400171	I HAD SO MUCH FUN WITH YOU YESTERDAY
027400173	READY UP ON THE BENEFITS
027400176	ALL I WANT TO BE HAPPY
027400201	I HOPE YOU FIND OUT WHAT THE WORD IS
027400238	NEED TO FIND A WAY TO FIX THAT
027400246	TRULY IT WILL BE A NIGHT TO REMEMBER
027400276	THAT IS NOT A SALARY
027400283	CAN WE TALK ABOUT HAIR
027400286	LOVE MAKES ME FEEL ALIVE
027400289	IT WOULD BE A GREAT FOR US TO ADD HIM
027400295	SO YOU KNOW IS GOING TO BE FUN
027400321	I WALK INTO THE ROOM TRYING TO SMILE
027400372	SPRING AND THE BIRDS ARE COURTING
027990028	HE RUNS HE BLOCKS HE CATCHES THE BALL
027990046	WE HAVE THE EARLY SIGNS
027990056	ON SUNDAY NONE OF THAT COUNTED FOR ANYTHING
027990059	PEOPLE ARE GETTING BACK TO WORK
027990066	IT SHOW THE WEAKNESS OF THE MOVEMENTS
027990153	IN A WORLD CUP GAIN
027990156	LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT YOU HAVE TO OFFER
027990160	I HAVE A NEW THING ON THE FRIDGE
027990162	TIME TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE FOR A WHILE
027990167	YOU TALKED YOU CAUGHT YOU SCORED
027990201	WHAT TO EAT IF YOU HAVE NO MONEY
027990232	YOU SHOULD KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THEM
027990242	LOOKING FOR A GOOD GIFTS
027990247	JOY CAN BE HARD TO FIND SOMETIMES
027990264	I WILL NOT HESITATE TO CALL THE POLICE
027990309	THE HOUSE WAS TOO BIG
027990328	THE TOP OF ITS HEAD WAS STILL OPEN
027990330	THE DOOR WAS OPENED WITH DIFFICULTY
027990341	HE MARKED THEIR PROGRESS ON THE CHART
027990358	BUT PERHAPS FOR HIM IT WAS NOT TOO LATE
028920012	SENDING YOU LOVE AND BLESSINGS
028920027	I THINK HE'S IN A REAL BIND
028920044	ONE WAS KILLED AND THE OTHER WAS WOUNDED
028920050	THOSE ARE FAITH FAMILY AND FREEDOM
028920120	HE'S BETTER THAN A TANK
028920122	HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD MEAL
028920128	SO DO YOU NOT HAVE IT
028920131	AND WE NEED TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR IT
028920174	THIS IS AN OLD PATTERN
028920200	I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SEE THIS
028920207	MY HEART IS FULL OF LOVE
028920213	THEY MADE IT EASY TO FIND EVERYTHING
028920214	I AM READY TO MOVE UP AND ON
028920224	WE SHOULD BE MORE SELFISH
028920235	I THINK YOU CAN TAKE IT YOURSELF
028920239	WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR TODAY
028920242	WANT TO GET RID OF THOSE DARK SPOTS
028920259	I WANTED HER TO BE MY DAUGHTER
028920315	MAY PASSED IN A BLAZE OF SUNSHINE
028920321	WHAT COULD HAVE MADE HIM
028970002	WHY WOULD I WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
028970016	HE MAY COME BACK TOMORROW WITH ANOTHER OFFER WHO KNOWS
028970022	IT COULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING THERE
028970039	SO FAR NO ONE IS EXPECTED TO LOSE THEIR JOB
028970052	THE STORM HIT ABOUT AN HOUR LATER
028970057	BOTH PLAYERS HOWEVER WERE AFFECTIES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
028970088	I AM GOING TO LEARN
028970129	STUFF FOR THE OTHER ACCOUNT
028970146	THIS IS THE ONLY ONE I FOUND
028970153	GREAT BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION
028970158	I WAS JUST GOING TO WRITE THAT

028970221	PERHAPS YOU CAN HELP ME
028970245	HELLO RICH I AM SORRY TO HEAR THIS
028970251	HAD A GREAT FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL
028970273	THIS IS AN OLD ARREST
028970279	WHY DO YOU NEED ME NOW
028970294	WELL THAT IS A VERY FAIR POINT
028970329	I SHOUTED AS I JUMPED OUT OF THE TRUCK
029170012	THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON I LIKE TO DEAL WITH
029170043	I BELIEVE I'M THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB
029170055	THE GENERAL CONCLUSION WAS THAT IT IS NOT THAT SIMPLE
029170086	IT WAS A GREAT PLAY
029170104	OIL PRICES ALSO ROSE SHARPLY
029170149	BUT DO YOU HAVE IT IN BLACK
029170156	WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR IT
029170161	SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS LET ME KNOW
029170177	DOING IT RIGHT DURING THE LAST WEEK OF WORK
029170181	GREAT PICTURE OF THE FIELD
029170196	THE ONLY IN THE LEAGUE
029170197	I WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS THREAD
029170211	WILL HAVE TO FACE THE MUSIC TOMORROW
029170226	THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST THOUGH
029170231	IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST ONES TO ME
029170252	NEW ONE FOR THE GIRLS
029170309	HE HAD NEVER HAD AN ATTENDANT FOR HIS OWN PERSON
029170321	YES BY THE MEMORY OF MY FATHERS
029170359	I WAS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE MASTER TO ANOTHER

055470129	IT WAS SOME ONE ELSE
055470131	WE WALKED FOR AN HOUR
055470141	I I SAW HIM MORE THAN ANGRY NOW
055470152	I'M NOT SO BAD AS ALL THAT
055470170	SHE HAS A LITTLE MONEY
055470172	DOES HE TREAT YOU WHERE
055470175	WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE
055510024	I HAVE LIVED IN THE PLACE
055510029	WHEN COULD WE DO IT
055510046	SHE IS BETTER OFF THAN I CAN MAKE HER
055510061	BUT SHE COULD NEVER BE CROSS WITH HIM
055510067	HE WOULD BE GOING AWAY
055510070	FOR AN HOUR THEY WALKED AND TALKED
055510078	AND NOW GO AWAY
055510079	YOU MAY SAY THAT TURNED
055510084	THEN SHE WAS LEFT ALONE
055510088	WHAT IS BIG AND WHAT IS LITTLE
055510093	AND YOU'RE THE SAME MAN TOO
055510096	SHE COULD NOT FACE IT
055510100	YOU SHALL SOON HAVE HER BACK
055510110	I COULD NEVER LOVE YOU AGAIN
055510122	FOURTEEN FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY
055510130	WAS IT NOT BY HIS DONE WILL
055510143	WHO WOULD HAVE BROKEN THE NEWS TO THE FATHER
055510156	I SHOULD CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE
055510164	FATHER IS ALONE YOU WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU
055510165	IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT
060100004	SHE TURNED ROUND AS THEY ENTERED
060100009	THE VOICE CAME FROM ABOVE THEM
060100031	HE IS MADE SO AS NOT TO BE AFRAID
060100034	WHAT WHAT DID HE WANT THERE
060100037	THAT'S WAS THE DIFFERENCE
060100041	THERE WHERE NO MEANS OF DOING IT
060100047	BUT SUCH IS THE WAY ALL THE GREAT
060100066	THEY ALL SAID GOODBYE
060100081	I DID MYSELF SO I KNOW WHAT THIS LIKE
060100092	I WENT OUT LAST
060100100	WOMEN SAY THOSE THINGS BUT NEVER DO THEM
060100101	THESE VISITED SHE RETURNED
060100105	IT IS SO NATURE IS MADE
060100124	AS I COULD
060100128	SOME OF THE MEN WHERE TALKING AWAY THE TABLES
060100132	MY DAUGHTER YOU MUST RETURN TO YOUR PLACE
060100147	IT WAS MY LAST WEEK THERE
060100154	HE LOOKED AROUND HIM AND BEGAN
060100159	THE OTHER HAVE ALL RETURN
060100164	AND HE WENT BACK FOR MORE
060480005	FOR THESE HE TOOK THE MONEY
060480008	WHAT DID YOU NOT LET ASK KNOW
060480012	IT OFTEN HAPPENS SO IN LIFE
060480018	BUT YOU SIDE JUST NOW
060480037	WHAT IS THERE SUCH A PLACE
060480050	I HAD HIT HIM AT LEST
060480082	LET US GO SET SHOE
060480084	HE STOPPED IN HIS WALK AND LOOKED AROUND
060480090	SHE CAME UP TO MY WITH MY SISTER
060480094	SHE DID EVERYTHING SO WELL
060480102	HE THEN WENT AWAY
060480104	AND SO HER LIFE WAS ONE OF LOVE
060480131	LITTLE BY LITTLE THE BOYS BEGAN TALKING AGAIN
060480134	SHE MAY BE PHONE
060480135	SHE WENT BACK INTO THE LIE LIBRARY
060480145	WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME ABOUT
060480147	WERE STAY AT NINE
060480148	DECIDE IT WHO CAN I CANNOT
060480168	HE KIT ME BY THE ARM
060480169	FOURTEEN FEEL AWAY AND THAT LEFT ONE
060670002	I THINK YOU DID NOT LIKE HIS PARENTS
060670003	IT WAS SUCH AS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR ME
060670017	OLD MEN LIKE MYSELF YOU CARE NOTHING ABOUT
060670029	I AM QUITE SURE I DID NOT
060670035	ONLY LAST WEEK I WAS ASKED TO COME HERE
060670036	SHE HAD OWNED IT AT LAST
060670038	WHAT WILL HAPPENED NEXT I WONDER
060670041	IS SHE YOUNG AND PRETTY
060670044	YOU HAVE HAD IF OF OUR QUIET LIFE A READY
060670049	I WAS ANGRY WHEN I WROTE THEM
060670060	I WONDER WHERE THE POOR LADY LEFT IT
060670062	BUT WONDER OF WONDERS
060670072	HE LOOKED VERY HIGH OVER HER HEAD
060670075	AND HOW ABOUT YOUR DAD LAST NIGHT
060670080	BUT AS SUCH SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF HIM
060670094	THE COWS NEVER GAVE SO MUCH MILK AS THAT NIGHT
060670111	I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND ENTERED
060670140	BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT
060670144	AND THESE MEN WOULD LET HER GO AGAIN
060670149	DID HE LOVE HER
060990011	TO BE SURE YOU DID
060990014	THIS IS WHAT ALL MEN DO
060990023	SHE SAID SHE WOULD SEE HER
060990029	IN THE EVENING I WENT AGAIN WHEN I SAW HIM
060990030	BUT I FOUND HER OUT AT LAST
060990034	LOVE HIM HE DID NO AND COULD NOT
060990035	BUT THE TWO DID NO FIT
060990039	NO USE STANDING HER
060990059	THESE THINGS AND MANY OTHERS INTERESTED HER
060990078	THE LOVERS WERE ALL AROUND ABOUT IT
060990083	I WONDER WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE
060990089	WE WENT OUT TO SEE HIM
060990093	YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WILL MEAN
060990117	BELL AS THEIR TRUE MAN OF THEIR TIME
060990121	WHY THEY HAVE LOST THEIR HANDS
060990124	SHE WAS MORE THAN HIS MUCH
060990129	BUT THERE IS NO CRY OF HELPING
060990155	AND HE HELD ALL THE HAND
060990168	BUT IN THE NAME OF WONDER WHY
060990175	THE MAN TOLD WILLING FOR HIS OTHERS
061210013	HOW COULD SHE HAVE THOUGHT THEM
061210031	NOW IT CAME TO ME
061210059	BUT HE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT
061210060	THEY HAD NO ENOUGH SPORT FOR ONE DAY
061210063	VERY WELL I HAVE NO MORE QUESTIONS TO ASK
061210068	I TOOK MY HEAD IN MY HANDS AND THOUGHT
061210069	AFTER A TIME HE TOOK UP HIS STORY
061210071	WHAT MORE DID SHE SAY
061210075	GOT THAT HAVE YOU
061210086	HE DID IT FOR ME
061210095	THAT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
061210109	I PASS HALF MY LIFE IN THE WOODS
061210128	DO I NEED TO TELL YOU THAT I WONDER
061210129	OF COURSE I KNOW THAT ALL THIS IS VERY SERIOUS
061210140	HISTORY IT IS NOT
061210141	THE PRETTY NURSE LOOKED QUITE SORRY
061210142	HE TOOK UP A BOOK
061210147	MEN HOPED AND WERE AFRAID TO HOPE
061210148	AND DID YOU HEAR NOTHING
061210174	EVERYONE STARTED WITH SURPRISE
064010049	WHY BREAK EVERY TIE
064010056	THE CHILDREN PRESENTLY RETURNED
064010057	THE GIRL STOPED SHORT
064010066	OR WHY DID NOT JOB GO
064010067	THE HAND JUST WHERE HE WISHED
064010086	PROUD OLD FAMILIES I GUESS
064010092	CAMPED AT OUR OLD PLACE
064010093	AND THEN MY AUNT USE TO CRY
064010103	SHE STAMPS HER FOOT
064010107	OUR TRIP BEGAN BADLY
064010109	WOULD SHE WIN HIM
064010120	KNOWING CAME BY SEEING
064010123	PRESENTLY THE SNOW CAME
064010135	LIVELY NOW LIVELY MEN
064010141	THREE MEN IN RED COAT CAME
064010150	THE BOX WAS LARGE AND IMPORTANT NEAR THE STAGE
064010161	I WENT TO THE SEA WORLD TO SEE BEAUTIFUL FISHES
064010164	ALL MEN JUMPPED THEIR HANDS
064010172	AN EXAMPLE MUST BE MADE
064010173	MINUTE AFTER MINUTE WENT BY
065040005	WE CANNOT TAKE FROM THEM WHAT THEY HAVE NOT GOT
065040007	THEN SHE TURNED AND WENT
065040009	THERE IS ALREADY A PRETTY LARGER COLLECTION
065040011	I DID NOT GO NEAR THE TREE
065040028	I DO NOT WONDER AT HER FLYING FROM HIM
065040042	FOR YEARS THIS WENT ON
065040044	YOUR MOTHER WILL RIDE HOME WITH ME
065040045	SHE WENT OUT WITH DIRTY CAPS
065040049	YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF
065040077	SO THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
065040112	YOU FOLLOW MY MEANING
065040118	HOW ON EARTH DID HE GET THERE
065040124	THIS IS BECAUSE THEY EAT MEN
065040125	I ASK FOR THE LAST TIME
065040126	I WENT UP TO HIM
065040127	I TOOK THE BOOK FROM HER
065040133	WITH THAT FOR A START ALL MAY BE LEARNED
065040134	SHE HAD TO CHOOSE WHAT TO SAY
065040137	SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
065040160	HE MADE IT HIS HOME
069020006	THAT IS WHAT MR WRIGHT ASKS
069020020	AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER
069020024	WHAT DID I KNOW OF LIFE THEN
069020037	DID HE LEAVE THEM HERE
069020044	SAY SHALL IT BE HERE OR WHERE THEY ARE STANDING
069020048	BUT THEY CAN'T LAST
069020059	THEY DID NOT SEE THEM ANY MORE
069020065	SO I WENT AWAY AND SAID NOTHING
069020075	SHE MUST BE MADE TO STAY
069020090	I CALLED THIS ONE IN AND GAVE HIM HIS SUPPER
069020091	PUSHING THE DOOR OPEN I ENTERED
069020096	NO WONDER EVERY ONE HAS STOPPED TO LOOK
069020103	AT ALL EVENTS I WANT TO TRY
069020114	AS HE WENT HE CALLED OUT FOR HELP
069020123	DID I PLEASE YOU
069020143	THESE MEN DO NOT RETURN
069020155	BUT ANOTHER GOT THE PLACE
069020163	SHE DID NOT CRY AT ALL
069020168	THE CHILDREN STOOD BACK
069020175	AND WHAT DID THEY SEE
069120003	AND SHE TURNED AND WENT AWAY WITHOUT A WORD
069120014	WE ENTERED THE ROOM
069120020	AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER
069120025	BUT IT DID NOT COME
069120052	AND THEN WHAT DID SHE DO
069120059	THEY DID NOT SEE THEM ANY MORE
069120061	HOW WELL DID I KNOW HER
069120072	IT TURNED US TO SILK
069120083	MY FRIENDS FOUND WATER
069120087	SO PRETTY AND SO YOUNG
069120092	TOGETHER THEY HELD HIM UP
069120093	I GOT UP AND CROSSED THE ROOM TO HIM
069120094	SHE WANTED TO QUESTION HIM
069120106	THEN I TOOK HIS CHILD THERE
069120121	I WOULD NOT MYSELF SAY THAT IT IS SO
069120123	DID I PLEASE YOU
069120140	HE STOOD AWAY FROM HER IN HIS SHAME
069120151	SHE HELD HER HAND TO HIM
069120165	SHE MADE ME BETTER LAST NIGHT
069120170	BUT WE HAVE LOST THE BEST OF MEN
070010001	IT WAS GOOD FOR ME
070010002	WE HAVE CLIMBED ONE STEP UP THE LADDER
070010003	PLUS THE KIDS REALLY LIKE THE DOGS
070010004	EVEN WHEN WE LOSE IT USUALLY A VERY CLOSE GAME
070010005	MOSTLY THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN EUROPE FOLLOWS THE GAME
070010006	WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS SPORTS IN GENERAL
070010007	WAY TO HELP US ALL OUT
070010008	LOVELY TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE SIR
070010009	SUCCESSFUL FIRST DAY FOR COLLEGE
070010010	THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO START
070010011	LOVE IS A STRONG MAN IN THE MIDDLE
070010012	SOMEBODY LET ME KNOW WHEN IT'S OVER
070010013	YOU PUT IT ON WRONG
070010014	COMPETITION IS GOOD FOR THE INDUSTRY
070010015	SHE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE HOUSE AND STARTED
070010016	THEY MAY MAKE ME MORE UNHAPPY THAN I AM
070010017	SHE WOULD BE SORRY FOR HIS DEATH
070010018	MY PEOPLE WILL BRING YOU TO THE SHIP
070010019	IT WAS A PROOF OF HIS FRIENDSHIP
070010020	I FOUND I HAD NO NEED TO THINK
075510004	I SHALL END BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH HER
075510010	IT LOOKED LIKE ONE OF ALARM TO ME
075510017	YOU SAY YOU ARE A BUSINESS MAN
075510036	WE WISH ALL MAY TAKE WORRYING BY BUS
075510038	IF SO HAD YOU NOT BETTER SHOW IT
075510041	NOT ANYONE BUT YOU
075510057	HE CAN STILL BE SAVED
075510076	IS THERE ANYTHING MORE BEFORE I GO OUT
075510086	HE PUT IT BACK IN HIS POCKET
075510090	I COULD NEVER APPEAR BRIGHT BEFORE THE WORLD AGAIN
075510091	TO BEEN THING I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND
075510099	AT NIGHT I DREAM MY HANDS
075510129	WHEN IS THERE LETTER TO GO I WONDER
075510131	HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME RUSHING ABOUT IN IT
075510137	BUT THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE
075510142	THE WATER WAS WRONG AND WE HAD GREAT FUN
075510144	SHE WAS BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD
075510163	NOTHING WILL PUT AN END OF TO HIM
075510165	I THINK I CAN GUESSED AT THE PERSON
075510167	I HUNT ALL OVER THE TOWN TO FIND IT
080020001	BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY ALTOGETHER
080020002	IT WAS VERY VERY STRANGE
080020003	NATIONALLY THOUGH THE TREND IS BEGINNING TO TURN UPWARD AGAIN
080020004	WORRY IS PART OF LIFE
080020005	NO NEED FOR A DOCK
080020006	TIME FOR A BIT OF HONOR
080020007	CHECK OUT FOR THE WIN
080020008	IT'S GOING TO BE A BUSY WEEK
080020009	I HAVE NO ONE BUT MYSELF TO BLAMES FOR THIS
080020010	WHAT A PERFECT ENDING TO THE DAY
080020011	LOVING LIFE AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN MINE
080020012	COOL FOR HIM TO STICK UP FOR HER
080020013	DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF THINGS
080020014	THAT WAS HEAD TO SAY
080020015	WANT TO GO FOR A WALK
080020016	CHEERS TO A GREAT GROUP
080020017	FIRST PLACE IN THE DIVISION
080020018	MOVE THE STAR WITH MORE MOVES
080020019	IT'S BEING USED TO MAKE MORE MONEY
080020020	IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET THERE
080570004	YOURS IS A PRETTY BUSINESS
080570009	DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF IT
080570013	BUT SURELY THERE IS DANGER
080570014	THEN COMES A BLANK IN THE PAPER
080570031	IT SEEMED ALL THAT HE COULD DO TO SPEAK
080570053	RUNNING BY ME BEATING MY ME
080570067	HOW SHALL I DESCRIBE WHAT WE SAW
080570071	AT LEAST I SHALL BE WITH MY OWN PEOPLE
080570072	DRESS THEM IN BLACK AND PLACE THEM OUTSIDE MY TENT
080570080	IF PEOPLE LAUGHED AT HER SHE LAUGHED WITH THEM
080570081	YES I AM A ROMANTIC
080570087	AT LEAST HE COULD KNOW
080570089	SHE HAD STORED THEM IN HER OWN ROOM
080570102	IS NOT EVERY MAN ABLE TO SAY WHAT HE LIKES
080570127	THE DREAM WAS QUITE AT AN END
080570138	SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT
080570143	IT WAS A FINE NIGHT AND PRESENTLY THE MOON APPEARED
080570144	GET YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT TO ASK HER DOWN
080570146	HOW IS HE GETTING ALONG THIS MORNING
080570157	THE LAND WAS STILL LONELY
080630011	WHAT WOULD SHE DO UNDER THIS BE
080630014	THEIR FACES WERE SET HARD
080630019	DO YOU BELIEVE WE SHALL
080630030	LAUGH AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE
080630038	SOME SEEMED TO STAY HIS HAND
080630044	THE THING WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME
080630053	I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF SUCH A FRIEND AS YOU
080630062	WHY DO YOU HOLD SUCH LANGUAGE
080630086	IF SHE LOVES ME HE WILL READ MY WISHES
080630090	AND ALL UP AND DOWN THE ROADS EVERYBODY LIKES ME
080630091	NOW WILL YOU PLEASE SIT QUIRT STILL
080630093	SHE IS TALKING IN HER SLEEP

080630123	COME I WILL BE ANSWERED
080630125	STILL YOU MUST HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY
080630140	I KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT YOUR AGE
080630147	HIS OLD SISTER COULD NOT BELIEVE IT
080630152	DO YOU PROMISE TO DO THIS
080630155	OUR TEMPLE STAIRS ARE RATHER DARK
080630170	FAR BETTER NOW WERE THERE IS STILL TIME
080680011	I COULDN'T THINK OF SUCH A THING
080680020	I'M READY FOR THE MARCH
080680029	SO SHE HE WANTED IT EXPLAINED TO HIM
080680031	THAT EVENING SHE SHOWED HER LETTER TO HER FATHER

085850092	THE THIRD BLOW WAS THE ONE THAT KILLED IT
085850094	THE HALL WAS VERY QUIET
085850101	PUT YOU FOOT DOWN TOO
085850108	THE WHOLE THING WAS FAR TOO REAL FOR DREAMING
085850112	NOT TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT
085850119	FOR I WAS NOT YET SAFE
085850120	HOW LONG AGO THAT SEEMED
085850138	AS OF US WE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALONG
085850146	THEY WILL BE SURE IF ANY
085850161	I HAVE COME TO ASK HIM A FEW QUESTIONS
085850170	NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT NEVER IN MY LIFE
090340002	ALL THE REST YOU WILL SEE LATER FOR YOURSELF
090340007	OFFER HIM THAT FROM ME AND COME
090340021	BUT YOUR FRIENDS ARE PROUD AND RICH
090340032	NO CREATURE EVER WANTED SO MUCH TO LIVE
090340039	BUT THERE WAS TROUBLE ENOUGH AT THE OTHER END
090340041	THIS IS THE STUFF TO PUT LIFE IN YOU
090340043	WHAT ABOUT THAT LETTER YOU WERE SPEAKING OF AT BREAKFAST
090340054	AND THEIR HANDS MIGHT JOIN
090340071	USE ME LIKE A STAFF
090340085	I BY NO MEANS WISH TO DIE
090340088	YOU CAN SEE THE REST
090340090	BUT WHAT ELSE HAD HE A RIGHT TO EXPECT
090340108	I HAVE MY OWN PLAN
090340114	I ASKED WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE WAS
090340126	I AM NO LONGER A PARTNER IN THE HOUSE
090340131	IT WAS MY SECRET AND HERS
090340155	BUT IN THIS WORLD WE MUST CONSIDER OTHERS
090340158	NOT ALL THAT MUCH ANYWAY
090340164	HAVE YOU HAD SIGHT OF ANYTHING
090340168	THEY REMAINED THREE HOURS AT TABLE TELLING ABOUT THEIR SPORT
090700006	HE COULD NOT SEE HIMSELF
090700008	ONE TWICE AND THE THIRD TIME DEATH
090700019	I MUST START AT ONCE
090700042	I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM BACK AGAIN IF I COULD
090700045	AN IMPORTANT PRODUCT SUCH AS THIS
090700047	MIGHT I ASK YOUR NAME
090700054	HOWEVER THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT
090700055	WOULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE TO FIND SUCH
090700057	HERE WE ARE THEN ALL SEATED ROUND THE TABLE
090700059	IN CHURCH AND WAITING ON TRAINS LIKE
090700065	THIS WAS THE PLAN THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF
090700081	THEY ARE OUT OF THE REACH OF ACCIDENT
090700082	THEY LIVED ON PUBLIC DEATH
090700108	HE MIGHT MARRY A GIRL WITH MONEY
090700111	AT LAST HOWEVER THE PARTY WAS MADE UP
090700117	I AM AFRAID HE WILL LEAVE US WITHOUT PITY
090700127	THIS SHALL BE THE PRICE OF HIS LIFE
090700148	THE COUNTRY IS PLEASANT FOR EXERCISE
090700164	I HAD AN APPOINTMENT HERE AT HALF PAST NIGHT
090700172	I THINK WE SHOULD BUILD GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM
090880018	IS THIS ANYTHING TO ME
090880060	YOU ARE NO LONGER KIND
090880064	EVEN THIS IS MORE THAN WE CAN SAY
090880065	OF COURSE THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE QUESTION
090880086	WILL YOU BE READY AT ONCE NOW
090880090	THEY HAD TO SUPPORT HIM AND PUT HIM TO BED
090880093	I MADE MY VOICE SOUNDS CARELESS
090880095	AMERICA'S GOING THROUGH JUST ABOUT THE SAME EXPERIENCE AS MYSELF
090880100	AND NOW YOU EXPECT THAT SHE SHOULD DO SO
090880120	THINK OF ME AS THROUGH I WERE YOU SISTER
090880126	HE IS WORSE THAN LAST YEAR
090880130	DO YOU REALLY AND TRULY SAY SO
090880132	I SHALL DO MY PARKING
090880140	NOW LET ME HAVE YOUR ATTENTION
090880142	THESE WERE NOT THE ALL MOST IMPORTANT THING HOWEVER
090880145	IT WAS AS STILL AS DEATH
090880147	CAN I TRUST MY OWN EARS
090880154	IF NOT WE MUST BREAK IT OFF
090880157	THE NAMES REMAINING WERE CALLED IN THE SAME MANNER
090880163	I'LL DO NOTHING UNTIL I HAVE READ THE ANSWER
091010017	HE IS BURNING TO HAVE AT SOMEBODY
091010032	IT WANTS WHOLE BOAT TO ITSELF
091010049	ENGLISH LIFE IN THEM THERE WAS NONE
091010050	HE SENDS ME FOR THAT PURPOSE AND HERE I AM
091010055	SHE TRY AND SHE SUCCEED
091010063	WE NEED NOT STAY UNLESS YOU LIKE
091010070	BUT ENGLISH ARE FOOLS
091010072	IF YOU MAKE ANY NOISE WE ARE LOST
091010082	HE IS RICH MAN
091010100	HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD WAIT FOR HIS RETURN
091010107	IF YOU NOT MORE THAN TEN I WILL MAKE FIGHT
091010109	BUT YOU HAD BEST WASTE NO TIME ON QUESTIONS
091010123	HOWEVER YOU CAN PUT IT ON NOW
091010127	THERE SEEMED A WALL IN FRONT OF HIM
091010133	SHOULD HE EVER SEE HER AGAIN
091010138	COVERED WITH SHAME SHE COULD MAKE NO ANSWER
091010139	OTHER FURNITURE THERE WAS NONE
091010142	WE WERE ONCE MORE AT HOME
091010149	EACH MAN HAD A PIECE OF SOAP AND A TOWEL
091010151	COME IT WOULD GIVE ME SO MUCH PLEASURE
091070001	THE LAST STAGE WAS REACHED
091070033	SHE IS SO GENTLE AND SWEET
091070038	IF ANY MAN EVER LOVED A GIRL SHE LOVED YOU
091070040	BECAUSE EVEN NOW THINGS MIGHT TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY
091070049	THERE IS OUR STARTING POINT
091070056	THAT WAS THE REASON OF HIS GOING
091070061	THE SHOCK WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM
091070065	I HAD NOT THE HEART TO KILL HER
091070074	AND THE WHOLE COURT WAS PLACED UNDER HIS ORDERS
091070089	I LIFTED MY HEAD AND KISSED HER
091070108	I WOULD TRUST HIM AS I COULD TRUST MYSELF
091070135	YOU WIN THE PRIZE YOU SEE
091070138	MAYBE A LOT OF PEOPLE
091070140	YOU HAVE NO NEED TO TROUBLE YOURSELF TO COME
091070142	YOU START A QUESTION AND IT'S LIKE STARTING A STONE
091070143	SHE SENDS YOUR HER REGARD
091070162	THEN THIS WAS THE SECRET OF IT ALL
091070163	AND I WOULD HAVE KISSED YOU
091070174	ITS BEAUTY IS THE BEAUTY OF HIS OWN MIND
091070175	I SEE YOU ALL SWING IN A ROPE
091180015	HE IS TRULY A GOOSE AND NOT A DUCK
091180025	I WONDER IF SATURDAY WILL EVER COME
091180035	YES YOU WILL SEE HERE HAVE SPEECH WITH HERE
091180042	THREE WERE HAS BAD HAS HIMSELF
091180044	WHERE YOU NOT ABLE TO BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM
091180050	SHE WANTS TO ASK YOU HERSELF
091180056	SOMETHING TERRIBLE WAS IN PREPARATION
091180064	DO YOU EVER TRY ME
091180075	AS LONG AS YOU FIND ME WORK I WILL REMAIN
091180078	BECAUSE I SEE YOUR BODY ACTING IN A CERTAIN WAY
091180088	I TURNED MY EYES ROUND AS FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE
091180091	WOULD THE GENTLEMAN STATE HIS BUSINESS PLEASE
091180101	LAST TIME I WAS YOUR JEST
091180110	SHALL YOU STATE AT ONCE
091180133	HERE IS AN INSTANCE OF THIS FEELING
091180151	I SAVED MY CHICKENS THROUGH
091180157	DEATH IS ONLY A RETURN HIM AFTER ALL
091180159	THERE MUST BE AN END OF THIS
091180161	NOTHING REMAINS FOR US BUT WAIT AND HOPE
091180163	HE CAN ALMOST STAND ON HIS LEGS
095530005	I WISH I HAD NONE BUT MY OWN TO TELL
095530010	BE SEATED IF YOU PLEASE SIR
095530011	SHE WALKED THROUGH THE HOUSE
095530016	ALL OTHER TIME IS PEACE
095530028	BUT MIGHT NOT HE GET ANOTHER LESSON FROM THEM
095530041	SHE BELONGED TO HIM AND HE TO HER
095530049	BUT AT DINNER THERE WERE PLANS TO BE MADE
095530059	WHAT A GREATLY IT WAS
095530066	BUT THAT WOULD NOT ALONE EXPLAIN HIS PLEASURE
095530082	HE WAS FOR MOMENTS TURNED TO STONE BEFORE IT
095530083	BUT WHAT CAN BE THEIR AM
095530085	I HAVE HOWEVER FOUND THE FOLLOWING
095530116	HE SEEMED TO BE TALKING TO HIMSELF
095530118	BUT WHAT IS THE POINT OF IT
095530129	IF IT BE ON THE FINGER TAKE THE FINGER OFF
095530144	HE REACHED OVER AND TOUCHED HER HAND
095530152	HE COULD PAY NO ATTENTION
095530154	HE HAD ALMOST LOST HER
095530161	I KNOW THAT WAS UNDERSTANDING
095530173	I WANT THE TRUTH THE TRUTH
095550027	EVERYTHING IS AN EVENT AT SEA
095550043	AND THERE IS WORSE BEHIND
095550044	I SAW THE KEY WAS IN THE LOCK OUTSIDE
095550046	HE SITS BY HER SIDE FOR HOURS
095550051	WHAT CARE I IF SHE SHE SINK OR SWIM
095550053	WHO WOULD EVER WANT ONE OF THIS COLLECTION
095550073	SO FAR THEY WERE IN PERFECT AGREEMENT
095550075	THE LIFT HAD STOPPED AT THEIR FLOOR
095550081	AM I WORSE THAN YOU
095550082	HE DRESSED IT HIMSELF TWICE A DAY
095550092	DO ANYTHING BUT COME DOWNSTAIRS WITH ME
095550100	FROM THE COURT THE NEWS SOON REACHED THE TOWN
095550107	WE ARE BUT YOUNG ONCE
095550116	IT IS ALWAYS SAFE TO TRUST HIM
095550126	WOULD YOU EAT YOUR CAKE TWICE
095550134	HE SIGNED TO HER TO LISTEN
095550143	ALL THE SAME YOU MUST NOT REMAIN HERE
095550146	WE MIGHT PICK UP SOME POINTS
095550148	AND THAT MAKES IT WORSE
095550173	I THINK WE MAY EXPECT HIM BEFORE MORNING
095560005	I WANT TO BE ON THE SPOT TO HELP
095560008	HE MUST CONSIDER WHAT TO DO NEXT
095560010	SHALL I FEET HIM DOWN
095560017	MY FATHER THINKS TO PAINT THEM
095560031	NOTHING COULD TRUE HIM FROM HIS PURPOSE
095560037	DO NOT BE ANXIOUS ALL IS WHERE
095560051	HOWEVER HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER QUICKLY
095560054	HOW PLEASANT HER MANNER IS
095560069	THE HANDS POINTED FOR FOUR OH CLOTH
095560080	DO NOT EXPECT SO MUCH FOR MY KINDNESS
095560083	HOWEVER I KNOW WHAT HIS ADVICE JUST NOW WOULD BE
095560108	THESE WORDS CHEERED ME UP
095560115	WE SHELL HAVE A SOME TROUBLE
095560129	THERE WILL PROBABLY BE NONE
095560133	HE AND HIS BROTHER SEEMED TO CHANGE PLACES
095560150	HE WAS NOT A PROPER PARTNER FOR HER
095560153	I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE A REACHED YOUR AIRS
095560163	I MIGHT AS WELL GO
095560164	WHEN I SEE IT REACH YOUR HAND I FINE
095560170	OH HOW PAINFUL ALL THIS IS
095580008	I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF HIS DEATH
095580012	SHE WAS JUST IN TIME TO HEAR THE DIRECTION
095580016	IT WOULD HAVE SPARED ME ALL THIS WORRY
095580039	IF THIS WERE TRUE WHO COULD BE UNHAPPY
095580045	I SHALL NEVER GETS THE ANY INTEREST FOR MY MONEY
095580056	THERE ARE NONE SUCH IN THIS PARTY
095580067	WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO HIDE YOU
095580071	THE SECOND WAS RATHER LESS SIMPLE BUT NOT MUCH LONGER
095580078	AND THEIR END WAS THE SAME
095580088	PUT THESE CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE HER FROM ME THEN
095580097	I THOUGHT YOU WERE SURE THAT HE WAS GUILTY
095580099	WEIGH THE OFFERS THEY WILL MAKE YOU
095580101	BUT THIS IS ASKING FOR THE WORLD AND NOTHING LESS
095580102	HE BOWED AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
095580116	SEE THEM AND HEAR WHAT THEY CAN ADD
095580128	IT IS YOUR DUTY MY SON
095580133	I THINK THAT SHE HAD NO CAUSE TO LEAVE ME
095580157	SHE IS A GIRL WITH A LOT OF TALENT
095580166	I SHALL PUT HIM IN THE ADVERTISEMENT THIS TIME
095580173	THIS MESSAGE GIVES ME HOPE
096000002	BUT IT IS STILL ONLY THE FIRST QUARTER
096000003	AND FOR ALL YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE RIGHT
096000004	WE ARE GOING TO KILL THEM BUT NOT THAT WAY
096000005	I HAVE LOOKED WITH MY VERY EYES ON HELL
096000006	IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE LOST OR SOMETHING
096000007	HE MADE NO MOVE IT WOULD COME WHAT WOULD COME
096000008	HE WAS THERE WHEN HIS BEST FRIEND ASKED HER OUT
096000009	WHAT WAS HE EVEN ABOUT TO SAY
096000010	I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER SMILE AGAIN
096000011	YOU AND I WANT THE SAME THING
096000012	THIS WAS THE MAN WHO HAD KILLED HIS FATHER
096000013	THEN I SAW HIM AT ONCE
096000014	I MUST HAVE WALKED INTO IT
096000015	HE PUT HIS OTHER HAND ON THE WALL AS WELL
096000016	BUT I WAS YOUNG THEN AND A LITTLE TOO CURIOUS
096000017	SHE'S LEFT ME HERE TO FACE HIM ON MY OWN
096000018	SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND LOOKED AROUND THE BATHROOM
096000020	I DO THOUGH AND I AM TRYING TO MAKE DO
096000021	IT WAS NOT LIKE SHE HAD ANY POWER OVER ANYTHING
096000022	SHE SHOULD BE THERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR
096010001	THERE WAS NO WAY SHE COULD USE IT
096010002	HE PUT DOWN HIS STERN AND LOOKED AGAIN
096010004	SHE OPENED HER EYES STARING UP AT HIM
096010005	BUT HE CAN DO THINGS BUT THIS
096010006	I WONDER THAT WE WERE STILL SO LONG
096010007	YOU MAY NOT WANT TO KNOW
096010008	SO HE CALLED AND ASKED ONE MORE TIME
096010009	AND THEN THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
096010010	SHE TURNED AWAY FROM ME AND SUDDENLY BACK
096010011	THAT YOU LOVE ME AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU
096010012	IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH IF THEY HAD ONLY THOUGHT
096010013	WHAT HE SAW ABOUT HER THAT MADE HER SPECIAL
096010015	I TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK THE DOG OVER
096010016	HE IS THE BEST COOK IN THE WORLD TOO
096010018	THE OTHER WAS A GIRL AS WELL
096010019	THEY WALKED THE REST OF THE DAY AND ALL NIGHT
096010020	SOMEWHERE THERE HAD TO BE A PLACE BETTER THAN THIS
096010021	HE SHRUGGED ME OFF LIKE I WAS NOTHING
096010022	IT IS NOT THE FACE HE KNOWS THOUGH
096010023	YOU FEEL LIKE A LITTLE BROTHER TO ME
096040001	HE JUMPED UP BUT ALL WAS STILL ABOUT HIM
096040002	SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HER OTHER FRIENDS
096040004	IT IS ONLY FOR YOU
096040005	THEY WOULD NEVER ACCEPT ME AS A GIRL
096040006	I COULD SEE THAT HIS HANDS WERE SHAKING TOO
096040007	SOON YOU WILL HAVE TO GO OUT ON YOUR OWN
096040008	THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT
096040009	THIS WAS NOT MY DAY
096040010	YOU JUST KNOW THAT IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD RIGHT
096040011	I WONDER WHAT WAS GOING ON OVER THERE
096040012	SO ARE YOU HERE TO PLAY WITH ME
096040014	IF YOU WANT TO PROVE SOMETHING THEN DO IT
096040015	THAT WAS WHEN HE SAW IT
096040016	THE MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AND LOOKED INTO IT AGAIN
096040018	AND PUT A HAND DOWN TO HELP HIM UP
096040019	THEY WALKED SLOWLY TO THE VERY END OF IT
096040021	WHAT WAS HE DOING AT THIS MOMENT
096040023	I AM RICH AND SO WAS MY FATHER BEFORE ME
096040024	SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A BREATH OF LIFE
096040025	THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY IT
096060001	HE HAD COME OUT ON JOBS WITH ME BEFORE
096060002	I JUST LOOK AT HIM
096060003	THE TWO OF YOU WILL NEED IT
096060004	BUT SHE IS MY LIFE
096060005	IN HIS EYES HE ONLY SAW HER
096060006	WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN NOW DO WE
096060007	I LOOKED OVER THEM ALL
096060008	THERE IS NO HOPE FOR ANY OF US HERE
096060009	IT WAS AN AWFUL THING YET WHAT COULD HE DO
096060010	YOU THOUGHT THE DREADFUL PLACE HAD YOU ONCE MORE
096060011	I LET THE TIME GET AWAY FROM ME
096060012	HE OPENED UP THE DOOR
096060013	THEY HAD A LITTLE GIRL
096060014	I TURNED TO GO THE OTHER WAY
096060015	SHE WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
096060016	THIS IS WHEN ALL OF THE GUARDS BUT ONE LEFT
096060017	HE MUST TURN AROUND TO SEE IF IT IS HER
096060019	I SHOULD NEVER DO IT AGAIN
096060020	I ASKED AS HE MADE A LONG PAUSE
096060022	THAT WAS ALL SHE NEEDED TO DO RIGHT
096070002	BUT THERE WAS NO ONE COMING HIS WAY
096070003	HE WOULD DO IT FOR THEM YES FOR THEM
096070005	I COULD TELL THEY WERE PLOTTING SOMETHING BUT WHAT
096070006	IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT HIM
096070007	I AM NOT HAPPY WITH YOU RIGHT NOW
096070008	THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO WALK OUT AGAIN
096070011	I LIKE TO SEE A MAN ENJOY HIMSELF
096070012	WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU
096070013	THE OTHER TURNED BACK TO THE DOOR SHAKING HIS HEAD
096070014	HE WALKED INTO THE ROOM HE HAD JUMPED FROM
096070015	HE THEN ASKED ME IF I WAS AN ENGLISHMAN
096070016	THAT WAS WHEN SHE SAW IT
096070017	SHE HAD HER HAND OVER HER LEFT CHECK
096070018	THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST CHAPTER
096070019	IT WAS TOO MUCH TO TAKE
096070020	APART FROM THAT I HAVE VERY LITTLE TO SAY
096070021	HE STILL HAD TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT
096070022	SHE STOPPED TO LOOK DOWN ON HIM
096070023	HE TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED AT ME WHAT
096070024	SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A MURDERER AFTER ALL
096080003	YOU MUST NOT THINK OF THE PAST NOW
096080005	SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD NEVER COME HERE
096080006	THEY WERE ALREADY IN AND SEEMED LIKE THEY SAW NOTHING
096080007	THE SAME LOOK OF CONFUSION IS ON HIS FACE
096080008	THERE WAS NO WAY WE COULD GET OUT
096080009	BUT STILL I WOULD DO MY BEST
096080010	SO THIS WAS ALL OVER HIM
096080012	AND THERE SHE WAS WITH ANOTHER MAN
096080013	I KNOW YOU JUST AS WELL AS YOU KNOW YOURSELF
096080014	IT WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT
096080015	SHE HAVE TO MAKE UP THINGS IF EVER
096080017	SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND THOUGHT BACK
096080018	WE TALKED ALL NIGHT AGAIN ABOUT THIS AND THAT
096080021	WHAT WAS THERE AFTER THIS WHICH HE MIGHT NOT DO
096080022	HE REACHED FOR HER HAND SHE LET HIM TAKE IT
096080023	I SUPPOSE IT IS BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD TELL ME
096080024	THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT WERE LOOKING AT US
096080025	HE WATCHES ME DAY IN AND DAY OUT
096080026	THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW MY FATHER
096080027	YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WITH THEM OR BE LEFT BEHIND
096090001	IF HE WAS CALLED UP AGAIN HE WOULD GO AGAIN
096090003	THE GIRL THEN LOOKED AT HER HAND
096090005	WHAT WILL THEY DO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME
096090006	WE HAVE THE BEST PEOPLE ON THIS
096090007	IT WAS AS MUCH AS MY LIFE WAS WORTH
096090008	THERE WAS NO WAY TO TELL FOR SURE
096090010	I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT NOT NOW
096090011	I COULD JUST BARELY SEE IT FROM HERE
096090014	I MADE HIM LOOK ME INTO THE EYES
096090015	THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK
096090017	I WAS COMPLETELY IN MY OWN WORLD RIGHT NOW
096090018	THAT MUST NOT BE IT
096090019	I WAS FOUND BY THEM WHEN I WAS A BABY
096090020	BUT EVEN THAT IS PUTTING HER WILL FIRST
096090021	SO I WILL MAKE A BARGAIN WITH YOU
096090023	I HAVE WATCHED YOU LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT
096090024	SHE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT OF ME AS AN ENEMY
096090025	BUT WHERE WAS SHE THAT SHE SEEMED SO ABSENT
096090026	HE WAS AT A BETTER PLACE
096090027	SHE ACCEPTED IT AND PUT IT WITH HER THINGS
096100001	SHE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH ONE OF THE HORSE
096100002	BUT HOW COULD SHE HAVE NOT KNOWN THAT
096100003	ACTUALLY THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO FOR ME
096100004	HE PULLED IT OUT AND LOOKED AT IT
096100005	SHOULD I KNOW HER AGAIN IF I SAW HER
096100006	AND THEN HE HAD A BETTER IDEA
096100007	COULD THIS GIRL BE LIKE HIM IN SOME WAY
096100008	IT WAS STILL ON HIS BACK
096100009	WE ALL WERE A LITTLE
096100010	SHE JUST NEVER WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT EVEN NOW
096100011	I MADE UP MY MIND TO GO AT ONCE
096100012	NONE OF THEM HAD THOUGHT TO LOOK BEHIND THE DOOR
096100013	IF SO WHAT WAS IT
096100014	THIS TIME I WAS RIGHT
096100015	HE TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY FROM HER
096100016	I ACTUALLY THINK WE MIGHT MAKE IT OUT OF THIS
096100017	THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR ME
096100018	WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD SHE COME TO BE
096100019	IT WAS WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG
096100020	I ASKED TO BE SURE
096110001	THEY JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WAS ALL RIGHT
096110002	HE COULD SEE IT WISH HE COULD NOT
096110003	BUT THE EYES WERE THE THING
096110004	AND A GIRL AT THAT
096110005	IT IS YOU WHO IS NO MATCH FOR ME
096110006	YOU GET TO DO THIS JOB ON YOUR OWN
096110008	NO ONE HAD TO KNOW
096110009	I SAY AS I TAKE OUT MY PAPERS
096110011	HE LEFT THEM THERE FOR A LONG TIME HANGING THERE
096110012	I BELIEVE WE SHOULD ALL COME WITH YOU
096110013	I THOUGHT ABOUT IT MORE
096110014	I HAD TO TURN MYSELF AROUND AND GO BACK
096110015	I TURNED TO LOOK BEHIND ME AND SAW NOTHING
096110016	IT WAS THE JAPANESE MAN FROM THE OTHER NIGHT
096110017	HE SEEMED MADE TO LIVE WITH NO ONE BUT HIMSELF
096110018	THIS WAS GOING TO BE A GOOD FIGHT
096110019	WHY WOULD SHE WANT HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE
096110021	BUT THAN THERE WAS STILL HER FATHER
096110022	WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO HERE
096110023	BUT I THINK HE MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC
096120001	SHE SAW IT ALL IN A MOMENT
096120002	I WANT TO SEE HIM MYSELF
096120003	THERE WAS REALLY NO WINNING WITH HER WAS THERE
096120004	AND THEN SOMETHING KNOCKED ME OUT OF THE WAY
096120005	HE HAD THOUGHT THEY WOULD NEVER COME BACK
096120006	BUT WHAT TRICK DO YOU HAVE FOR US NOW
096120007	IT IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN
096120008	I LOOKED OVER AT THEM
096120009	IF SHE WANTED TO SHE COULD BE VERY POPULAR
096120010	THEY HAD TO LET GO
096120011	BUT WE LOOKED LIKE THAT A LONG LONG TIME AGO
096120012	HE TURNED AROUND AND WALKED AWAY TO THE PLATFORM
096120013	I AM A PLAIN MAN AND SAY WHAT I THINK
096120014	THIS WAS THE PLACE ALL RIGHT
096120015	HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE IT FROM HERE
096120016	HE WAS STILL AT HOME
096120017	HE ASKED HER ONE DAY
096120018	SHE HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAT NIGHT
096120019	HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE GIRL
096120020	BUT THAT IS AT AN END
096130001	I WANTED TO SEE THE WORLD
096130002	THAT WAS ALL HE COULD THINK
096130003	HE LOOKED AT HER FOR A LONG TIME
096130004	AND WHAT OF THAT MAN
096130005	SHE HAD LOVED BEFORE BUT NOT LIKE THIS
096130006	BUT SHE WOULD BE BACK
096130007	THERE IS NO PLACE FOR ME IN HIS HEART
096130008	I KEEP MY EYES ON HIM
096130009	IT SOUNDED AS IF HE WERE GOING TO SAY MORE
096130010	THE BEST ONE I HAVE
096130011	I JUST NEED TO GO THERE
096130012	THEN SHE SAW THE WAY OUT
096130013	HE THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING AND THEN HE ASKED
096130014	HE WAS HE ADMITTED NEVER VERY GOOD WITH HIS HANDS
096130016	I HAVE A GUN TO YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW
096130017	AND HERE YOU ARE AND YOU ARE SO PRETTY
096130018	I WALKED INTO THE ROOM MY HAND ON HER SHOULDER
096130019	HE TURNED AROUND TO FACE HER
096130020	THE FIRST THING IS TO GET HIM AWAY
096130021	I LOOK UP AT THE HOUSE
096140002	I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE ONE FOR THE SUBURBS
096140003	AND THERE WAS A STRANGE LOOK IN HER EYES
096140004	THE STUDENT THEN TURNED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED AT ME
096140005	BUT THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE
096140006	SHE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS
096140007	IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE HE COULD SEE ANYTHING
096140008	THERE WAS NO WAY THEY SAW HIM
096140009	NO I DO NOT OWN THEM
096140010	THEY WERE UP TO SOMETHING
096140011	YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHAT WAS ON MY MIND
096140012	I ASKED AS SHE CLOSED THE DOOR
096140014	HE WILL COME BACK IN A LITTLE WHILE
096140015	HE WALKED AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF HER BED
096140016	THAT WAS THE FIRST THING ABOUT HER THAT ATTRACTED ME
096140017	I MUST HAVE AN END PUT TO ALL THIS
096140018	IF NOT HOW SHOULD THEY KNOW HE WAS DEAD
096140019	WHAT ELSE WOULD I WANT TO HAVE
096140020	HE LOOKED OVER HIS HAND AND SMILED
096140021	I AM THE ONE WHO MADE YOU
096140022	I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO STAY THERE ONCE AGAIN
096150003	I ASKED WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE
096150005	BUT SHE HAD LEFT THAT LIFE BEHIND NOW TOO
096150006	THERE WAS NO WAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD BE REALITY
096150007	SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND IN ALL GOOD FAITH
096150009	THEY WERE GOING TO SEND HER BACK IN TIME
096150010	THE WOMAN TURNED HER HEAD TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW
096150011	THIS GIRL SHE WAS EVERYTHING I NEVER WAS
096150012	THERE WAS ONCE AGAIN SILENCE SO I LET IT BE
096150013	I HAVE TO GO SAY HI TO SOME MORE PEOPLE
096150016	HE THEN LOOKED DOWN AT HIS HANDS
096150017	I HAD VERY LITTLE OF MY OWN
096150018	HE ONE THE OTHER HAND WAS DIFFERENT
096150019	I HAVE NO PLACE IN YOUR HEART
096150020	IT WAS AN AFFAIR THAT BUT OF A MOMENT
096150021	I LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND FOUND THE TRUTH
096150024	IT WAS THE LITERATURE OF LOVE NOT OF THE LOVE
096150025	I WAS VERY NERVOUS FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THIS
096150026	I ACTUALLY OPENED MY EYES AND SAW WHERE I WAS
096150027	HE WAS EVER THE SAME TO ME
096150028	SHE MUST BE COMING FOR ME AGAIN
096160001	HE LOOKED UP AND SAW A MAN
096160002	ALL OF YOU WILL BE THERE
096160003	SHE COULD JUST SEE IT
096160004	BUT NO WAY TO FIND WHAT THEY NEED
096160005	THE FIRST ONE WAS HIS EYES
096160006	THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CARRIAGE WITH THEM
096160007	YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE STORY NOW
096160008	I DROPPED MY HAND AND PUT IT ON MY SIDE
096160009	AND TO THINK I COULD GET AWAY FROM WORK
096160010	THEY OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED IN
096160011	IT'S A GOOD THING NO ONE WAS AROUND THE PLACE
096160012	IF YOU ARE GOING TO COME IN THEN COME IN
096160013	I WANT TO FEEL YOU MORE AND MORE
096160014	NOW I COULD NEVER DO ANY OF THAT AGAIN
096160015	I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE A LONG LIFE
096160016	I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT THROUGH
096160017	IT SEEMED THAT WAS WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM
096160018	HE WOULD NOT LET THE CONVENTION END LIKE THIS
096160019	BUT EVEN THIS WAS AS NOTHING
096160020	HE STARTED TO ASK IF I WAS ALL RIGHT
096170001	SHE WAS JUST LIKE HE WAS
096170002	THEN ON OUT THE BACK DOOR OF THE HOUSE
096170003	HE LOOKED HERE AND THERE
096170004	YOU MAY NOT BE WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE
096170006	BUT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING HAD MESSED UP
096170007	AND ONCE MORE SHE WAS ALL HIS OWN
096170008	IT NEVER HAPPENED AND IT NEVER WILL
096170009	THEY ALL GIVE THEM TO HIM
096170010	THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY AROUND IT
096170011	THIS WAS THE THING SHE WANTED TO HEAR ONLY THIS
096170012	WE ARE GOING TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT
096170013	NO DOUBT HE WAS VERY GOOD AND ALL THAT
096170014	SHE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN
096170015	HE TURNED AND ASKED THEM
096170018	HE WAS TALENTED IN MORE THINGS THAN I WAS
096170020	SHE WAS LOOKING AWAY FROM HIM AT THE FIRE
096170021	SO THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO BE CALLED
096170022	AND EVEN AFTER THAT IT IS NOT MUCH BETTER
096170023	I LEFT THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF HIM
096170024	NOW SHE HAD TO DO THE SAME
096180001	AND SHE WAS INTIMATE WITH HIM AS AT FIRST
096180002	IT IS OVER IN A MOMENT
096180004	THEY WERE ON MY SIDE OF THE STREAM NOW
096180005	HE COULD NEVER SEE HER BEFORE
096180007	YOU STILL NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE
096180008	WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT CAN BE THERE
096180009	THERE WAS A MAN BEHIND ME
096180010	THAT WAS JUST HOW SHE WAS
096180011	THIS IS THE WAY OF LIFE
096180012	AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING ON HER MIND
096180013	I WANTED TO FIND MORE OUT ABOUT YOU
096180014	I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS A GOOD PERSON
096180015	WE COULD PUT YOU IN A WORLD OF HURT
096180016	BUT NOT VERY LONG WAS SHE LEFT IN DOUBT
096180017	SHE LET GO OF HIS HAND AND RUBBED HER EYES
096180018	I JUST WANT TO SEE HER SAFE IN YOUR HANDS
096180019	BUT HERE IT IS THAT I MUST MAKE MY CONFESSION
096180020	AND THEN THERE WAS AN END OF IT
096180021	I ASKED NOT EVEN LOOKING UP AT HIM
096180022	HE HAD CALLED THEM THAT HIMSELF IN HIS DAY
096190001	HE WANTED TO DO THIS RIGHT
096190002	BUT THERE WAS NO ONE
096190003	AND YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW
096190004	HOW COULD HE JUST FIND ME LIKE THAT
096190005	THEN SHE OPENED HER EYES AND LOOKED AT HER WATCH
096190006	IT IS WHAT HE WOULD WANT
096190007	THE GIRL SEEMED TO SEE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME
096190008	THERE WAS NOTHING HERE TO GO ON
096190009	YOU REALLY THINK YOU ARE GOING TO DEFEAT ME
096190010	BUT IT WILL GET BETTER
096190011	THAT WAS THE WAY OUT
096190012	HE HAD INDEED COME ON MORE THAN HE THOUGHT
096190013	BUT WE WERE STILL THE BEST OF FRIENDS
096190014	THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YOU WILL BE SAFE
096190015	THERE WAS ANOTHER LITTLE THING HE HAD TO SAY
096190016	HE ASKED AS HE PUT HIS ARM AROUND HER
096190017	WHAT ELSE WAS THERE LEFT TO DO
096190019	AND YET HOW INDIFFERENT IT ALL WAS TO ME NOW
096190020	AND THE WORLD IS OVER
096190021	I NEED TO MAKE IT
096220001	YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE
096220002	HE LOOKED BACK AT ME
096220003	SHE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
096220004	THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE SHE WANTED BY HER SIDE
096220005	BUT WHAT IF WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS RIGHT
096220006	IT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE
096220007	I AM NOT GOING OUT WITH YOU
096220008	THIS WAS NO TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE REAL WORLD
096220009	I TURNED TO FACE THEM
096220010	BUT IT CAN DO SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT
096220011	THEN THEY WERE AT THE SAME THING AGAIN
096220012	HE CLOSED HIS EYES AS HE WALKED
096220013	I ASKED IF THEY WERE IN A FIGHT OR SOMETHING
096220014	NO NO HE WAS TOO GOOD A WORKMAN FOR THAT
096220015	HE PUT HER DOWN AND PATTED HER ON THE HEAD
096220016	WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND SOME WAY OF HIDING IT
096220017	I HAD LEFT IT BEHIND
096220018	SHE TURNED AWAY WITH A LITTLE WAVE OF THE HAND
096220019	BUT LOOK AT YOU TWO
096220020	WHAT WAS HE LIKE IN PERSON
096230001	HE LOOKED AT ME AND SMILED AND I SMILED BACK
096230002	SHE WANTED TO GET OUT
096230004	IT WAS JUST A PERSON
096230005	THIS WAS WHERE SHE HAD LEFT THEM
096230006	THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HIM TOO
096230007	WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE THEN
096230008	THE TIME OF THE DAY
096230009	I COULD NOW SEE INTO HIS FACE
096230010	AND I NEVER THOUGHT A THING
096230011	THEY STOPPED AND HE WAS LET GO
096230012	I LOOK DOWN AND KNOW THE MAN IS DEAD
096230013	HOW LONG WAS HE GOING TO BE HERE
096230014	THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT FROM SIDE TO SIDE
096230015	THEN SHE TURNED TO ALL OF US
096230016	THAT WOULD MEAN THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE IT OVER
096230017	I WAS TIRED AND HAD OTHER THINGS ON MY MIND
096230018	WE MUST THINK OF THE GOOD AND NOT THE EVIL
096230019	NO IT WAS THE EYES
096230020	HE PUT HIS HAND ON THE KNOB AND OPENED IT
096230021	I STILL HAD NO IDEA WHO HE WAS
096240001	SHE WAS NEVER THE SAME
096240002	I ASKED THEM HOW DO I GET THERE
096240003	HE JUST TURNED AND LEFT
096240004	IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD
096240005	AND SHE AGAIN LOOKED DOWN FOR A MOMENT
096240006	THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME WERE NOT GOING TO LET UP
096240007	THAT IS THE WAY WE MUST BE IN THIS BUSINESS
096240008	BUT NO ONE WAS LOOKING AT HIM
096240009	YOU COULD TELL IT ON HIS FACE
096240010	THE END OF HER TIME WITH HER FRIENDS
096240011	THEY COULD ALL SEE IT NOW
096240012	THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE WOMAN THAT MADE HIM UNEASY
096240013	I WALKED OUT THE DOOR
096240014	IF SO THE SOONER HE WAS BACK THERE THE BETTER
096240015	BUT NOTHING HAPPENED TO ME I OPENED MY EYES
096240016	I HAD TO LOOK AWAY
096240017	I PUT MY HAND IN FRONT OF HER
096240019	IT WAS THE LAST THING HE COULD GIVE HER
096240020	SHE IS ON HER OWN WORLD
096240021	SHE HAD MORE THAN ONCE TO REMIND HIM OF THIS
096250001	AND I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
096250002	SHE TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED HIM IN THE EYES
096250003	IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO
096250004	THEY WOULD NOT KNOW IT
096250005	THERE WILL BE AN END OF THAT NOW
096250007	BUT OF ONE THING SHE IS SURE
096250008	YOU HAVE A GIRL WITH YOU
096250009	THIS WAS WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
096250010	THE MAN WALKED TO THE WOMAN
096250011	BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE TO COME
096250012	AND HE WAS STILL THAT LITTLE BOY
096250013	I HAD NO WHERE ELSE TO GO
096250014	I KNOW YOU WANT TO GIVE ME A GOOD LIFE
096250015	HE ASKED ALL OF US
096250016	I JUST HAD A LONG DAY
096250017	NO ONE WAS IN THE ROOM
096250018	HE LOOKED TO HIS SIDE AND SMILED
096250020	HOW MUCH WOULD THEY KNOW OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
096250021	SO ENJOY AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF IT
096250023	THEN SHE TURNED TO HIM
096260002	I LOOKED OVER AT HIM
096260003	IT WAS JUST YOU LAST TIME
096260004	THERE IS NO WAY I CAN GET BY THIS
096260005	BUT HOW WOULD THEY GO ABOUT IT
096260006	THEY ALL SMILED AT THE WORLD AROUND THEM
096260007	YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME WITH US NOW
096260008	NOW THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO
096260009	HE THEN WALKED FROM THERE OUT OF THAT ROOM
096260011	HE HAD NOTHING BUT THIS PLACE
096260012	HE STILL COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING
096260013	WE HAD TO MAKE IT
096260014	I NEED TO BE HERE
096260015	I SEEMED TO BE THE FIRST ONE DOWN
096260016	I HAD TO FIND A DIFFERENT BACK DOOR
096260017	HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY
096260018	I PUT MY HAND ON IT
096260019	IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE WHO IT WAS
096260020	THAT ALL I CAN EVER BE
096260021	AND THERE WAS AN END OF IT
096260022	HE WAS MORE THAN JUST A FATHER
096280011	YOU WILL HAND HIM OVER TO ME
096280012	HE WAS A GOOD MAN THOUGH
096280013	I WANT YOU AND YOU ARE COMING BACK WITH US
096280014	I SMILED AND WALKED OUT THE DOOR
096280015	I WANTED TO SEE WHO SHE WAS
096280016	AND HE PUT IT AGAIN
096280017	WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY FOR MYSELF
096280018	THIS WAS NOT RIGHT NOT RIGHT AT ALL
096280019	I AM SURE YOU KNOW IT
096280020	I CAN TAKE THEM OFF IF YOU NEED ME TO
096280021	I SAW AT ONCE HOW IT WAS
096280022	AND THERE IT STOPPED FOR A MOMENT
096280023	NO ONE WOULD GET THE BEST OF HIM
096280024	ALL THAT KIND OF THING WAS NOTHING TO HIM NOW
096280025	THE PERSON LOOKED AT THE BACK
096280026	SHE LOOKED HARD AT THE MAN
096280027	NOW THAT HE HAD THE TIME
096280028	BUT WHAT ELSE AM I TO DO
096280029	HE HAD TO GO THROUGH WITH IT
096280030	THERE IT WAS RIGHT NEXT TO HIM
096290001	HE WAS GOING TO HELP HIM
096290002	WHAT I DO KNOW IS THIS
096290004	SHE SMILED AT THE TIME
096290005	THEN IT WOULD ALL BE OVER
096290006	THAT HE COULD HAVE A HOME AGAIN
096290007	THERE WAS ONE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
096290008	BUT THEY WERE TURNED TO HIS LEFT
096290009	I THOUGHT FOR SURE SHE WOULD SAY SOMETHING
096290010	I WALKED UP TO MY ROOM
096290011	I CAN GET HER BACK
096290012	THE BOY LOOKED FROM THE HAND TO HER
096290014	HE SAW THE DAY WHEN IT HAD ALL HAPPENED
096290015	SHE ASKED LOOKING UP AT ME
096290016	I MADE IT TO HER HOUSE
096290017	I WAS STILL FOR A MOMENT
096290018	THIS WAS THE WAY IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE
096290020	SHE STOPPED WHERE SHE WAS AND LOOKED AROUND
096290021	AND THE FIRST THOUGH IN MY HEAD WAS
096290022	AND THAT WAS THE LAST I EVER SAW OF HIM
096290023	IT WAS NOT YET TIME
096300001	HOW WAS I GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE
096300002	HE LOOKED BACK AT HER
096300003	AND YOU LIKE IT THAT WAY
096300004	BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT SHE HAD WANTED
096300005	THEY ARE ONE IN THE SAME
096300006	SHE SMILED AND WALKED WITH HIM
096300007	THERE IS NO NEED TO GO THERE
096300008	SO WHAT THEN WERE WE TO DO
096300009	I THINK I WILL RIGHT NOW
096300010	YOU LOOK OVER AND YOU SEE A BOY
096300011	I SAW YOU TAKE THEM
096300012	I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I MADE UP MY MIND
096300013	THAT IS THEY WOULD IF I HAD ANY FRIENDS
096300014	THIS TIME IT WAS A WOMAN
096300015	I TURNED AROUND TO FACE IT
096300016	IT WAS THE ONLY ROOM WITH THE DOOR STILL CLOSED
096300017	AND IT JUST MIGHT BE
096300018	I LEFT HER AT HOME
096300019	HE LOOKED AWAY FROM IT
096300020	BUT IT WAS EVEN SO
096310001	HE COULD BUT WHAT WOULD HE DO
096310002	SHE SMILED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY
096310003	THERE WAS SOMETHING IN FRONT OF HER
096310004	IT WILL ONLY BE A MOMENT
096310005	THE WOMAN LOOKED UP TO HIM
096310006	THIS IS ALL I CAN SAY
096310007	BUT THE EYES WERE RIGHT
096310008	HE TURNED HIS HEAD TO LOOK AT THEM
096310009	I HAVE BETTER GET OUT OF HERE
096310010	AND THEN THERE WAS HER FACE
096310011	HE ALWAYS SAW IF SHE WANTED HIM NOT TO
096310012	I THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS ABOUT TO END
096310013	WHAT WOULD THEY BE LIKE TO WORK WITH
096310014	NOW ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME GO
096310015	I PUT THEM BACK ON AND LEFT
096310016	THAT WAS AS MUCH AS HE WOULD GIVE HER
096310017	THEY OPENED IT AND WALKED IN
096310018	I THINK IT WILL DO US ALL SOME GOOD
096310019	THE THING HAD COME AND SO IT MUST BE
096310020	HE WAS NEVER EVEN IN THE ROOM
096330003	HE LOOKED AT HER AND TURNED AWAY
096330005	I WILL FIND THEM FOR YOU
096330006	IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE ONE PERSON
096330007	THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE
096330008	YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME
096330009	I WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT
096330010	THEY HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE
096330011	THIS WAS NOT IN HIS MIND
096330012	WE WERE THE SAME I OPENED MY EYES
096330013	BUT HOW CAN SHE TELL WHO IT WAS
096330014	I JUST WANT HER BACK
096330015	THE GIRL WALKED IN AND LOOKED AROUND
096330016	HE WAS ALWAYS UP TO NO GOOD
096330017	IT WAS ONLY ONE AFTER ALL I SAY
096330018	THAT DAY WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM
096330019	AS IF TO BE BUT A MAN WERE NOTHING
096330020	BUT THEN AGAIN THIS WAS HER HOUSE
096330021	HE WAS NOT HARD TO SEE FROM WHERE SHE WAS
096330022	I DO LOVE YOU AND I CAN MAKE THINGS RIGHT
096330023	IT WAS AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FRONT DOOR
096340004	BUT AT THE END WHAT DO WE GET
096340005	THERE WAS NO WAY OUT OF THIS ROOM
096340006	THAT HAD TO BE IT THEN
096340007	IT IS A HAND ON MY
096340008	HE WILL WANT ME JUST FOR ME
096340009	THEY TURNED ALL TO HIM
096340010	AND I LIKE HER EYES
096340011	BUT HERE NOW HE REALLY WAS
096340012	THE OTHER ONE WAS BACK IT WAS TIME AGAIN
096340013	YOU ASKED TO SEE IT
096340014	I JUST WANTED TO GO UP THERE
096340015	I CAN ONLY DO IT ONCE
096340016	BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HELP IT
096340017	HE WALKED OVER TO THE DOOR AND OPENED IT
096340018	THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE TO IT THAN THAT
096340019	I LOOKED AROUND BUT I STILL FOUND NO ONE
096340020	I KNOW THAT THEY WILL NOT LET ME DOWN
096340021	THIS WAS THE GOOD SIDE TO IT
096340022	I NEVER SAW HIM LOOKING LIKE THAT
096340023	WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH HIM
096350006	THERE IS NO END TO THIS IS THERE
096350007	SHE WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM
096350008	IT SHOULD AS HE WAS ONE AFTER ALL
096350009	AND SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON LEFT
096350010	THE OTHER AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
096350011	I WILL FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON
096350012	HE ASKED IF I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MY FATHER
096350013	IT MADE ME WANT TO GET AWAY FROM HIM
096350014	I COULD NEVER GIVE YOU UP
096350015	IF IT BE SO I HAD BETTER GO
096350016	I PUT THEM ON AND I SAW WHERE WE WERE
096350018	I AM SURE YOU CAN DO IT
096350019	THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME TO YOU
096350020	AND YOU COME BEFORE THAT
096350021	BUT THEN I THOUGHT THERE WAS LITTLE NEED
096350023	BUT NOW I SEE WHO YOU REALLY ARE
096350024	IT WAS NOT HER PLACE TO SAY ANYTHING
096350025	I COULD FEEL HER EYES LOOKING AT ME
096350026	I LOOKED OVER TO THE SIDE
096350027	SHE TURNED TO FACE THE MAN
096390001	I WAS BACK IN THE ROOM
096390002	SHE LOOKED UP AT ME AND SMILED
096390003	HE WOULD NEVER DO THIS
096390004	WHAT COULD YOU DO WITH A GIRL
096390005	AND SHE HAD TO BE LIKE HIM
096390006	BUT HE WAS STILL THERE
096390007	YOU JUST HAVE TO MAN
096390008	I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY CAN DO
096390009	HE SAW NO NEED OF IT
096390010	THERE WAS BUT ONE THING LEFT TO DO
096390011	THEY ALL TURNED TO ME
096390012	I THINK I WANTED TO SEE HIM AGAIN
096390013	HE LOOKED TO HIS LEFT THEN TO HIS RIGHT
096390014	I HAD TO GO TO MY PLACE
096390015	IT WILL BE THE END OF THEM
096390016	THAT WAS ALL I WAS GOING TO SAY ABOUT IT
096390017	I WAS ON TO SOMETHING
096390018	SHE TURNED AROUND AND WALKED TO THE DOOR
096390019	I MADE IT JUST IN TIME
096390020	HE HAD NOTHING ELSE HE WANTED TO DO OUT HERE
096400001	WAS IT POSSIBLE TO INTERPRET THEM TO ANY USEFUL PURPOSE
096400002	NOT A LIVING CREATURE WAS VISIBLE
096400004	AND AFTER HE LEFT I FEEL EMPTY
096400006	THE RECEIVER HAD NOT SUFFERED AT ALL
096400007	WE WILL TAKE TURNS IN WRITING EACH CHAPTER
096400008	DEATH SHOULD BE VEILED THE GRAVE SHOULD HAVE ITS RESERVE
096400010	THEY WERE SILVER WITH NO PUPIL
096400012	TOO LONG TOO SHORT TOO BORING
096400013	TROOPS ARE MARCHING INTO BATTLE
096400014	WAITING FOR WHAT SHE THOUGHT
096400016	HER EYES USUALLY SO GENTLE FLASHED FIRE
096400018	PLEASE FORGIVE ME MY FRIEND
096400019	THAT'S WHY WE BOTH PASSED OUT
096400020	AUTHOR NOTE HELLO AGAIN EVERYONE
096400021	EVERY MINUTE SEEMED LIKE AN HOURS
096400022	ALL HEADS TURNED THEIR WAY
096400024	BUT THIS WANTS FARTHER EXPLANATION
096400025	MY OWN OWN DARLING DARLING DARLING JEWEL
096400026	YOU MAY CONTINUE GUN TRAINING
096400028	IT'S ALMOST PAST YOUR BED TIME
096430002	SHE PRESENTED HIM WITH A ROSE
096430003	AT LAST OUR RANKS WERE BREAKING
096430004	NO SUCH LUCK GRACED HER HOWEVER
096430005	THE MACHINE MUST HAVE HELPED ME STAY AWAKE
096430006	THEY ALL JUMPED UP FROM THEIR SEATS SUDDENLY
096430007	IT'S NO PROBLEM SHE WAVED OFF
096430008	LET US BEGIN ON THOSE DEBTS
096430009	TO RESTORE YOUR LOST ENERGY
096430010	WE SHIFT BACK INTO SILENCE
096430011	HE NODDED SLOWLY AND IMPRESSIVELY
096430012	IT HAD VERY NEARLY COME
096430013	YOU KNOW THEY CAN PROBABLY DO THAT
096430014	A COOL ONE THIS GENERAL
096430015	MAYBE SOON BUT CERTAINLY NOT NOW
096430016	EVEN IF IT TAKES SEVERAL YEARS
096430017	MY BREATH COMES IN IN SHARP PAINFUL BURSTS
096430018	SO EVERYONE WOULD BE SATISFIED
096430019	THIS FLOOR LOOKED REALLY RUN DOWN
096430020	IN FACT WE FOUND THEM EXCEEDINGLY USEFUL
096430021	TAKE OUT OR HOME COOKED
096450001	WHY WAS NATURE SO CRUEL
096450002	AT THE SAME TIME THE SAME FLOWER
096450003	DO YOU THINK ANYONE ELSE IS ALIVE OUT THERE
096450004	HE NEVER SHUT HIS EYES
096450005	I AM NOT A CHILD NOR YET A FOOL
096450006	FINALLY SHE TURNED AND FACED HIM
096450007	LET US INSTALL OURSELVES IN THIS HALL
096450008	YOU ARE MY HEART NOW
096450010	IT LOOKED PEACEFUL DELICATE ALMOST JAPANESE
096450011	THE SOLDIER STARED INTO SPACE MIND RACING FURIOUSLY
096450012	BETTER THAN OTHER GIRLS THAT'S FOR SURE
096450013	AND WHEN THEY GET WHAT THEY WANT THEY WANT MORE
096450014	NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH YOUR THING
096450015	BUT SHE'S HERE HELPING ME
096450016	DEATH ITSELF HAD COME WITHOUT PAIN
096450017	REMOVAL OR LESSENING OF EITHER
096450018	HIS FATHER CALLED DOWN BELOW
096450019	A SILLY BUSINESS ON ALL SIDES
096450020	SHE STARTED EATING BEFORE GIVING HER OPINION
096450021	FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE
096460002	A QUICK JUMP OVER THE WIDENING GAP SAVED HIM
096460003	HE DRIFTED OUT AND AWAY ALONG SUNSET TRACK
096460004	THE MOON WOULD NOT RISE TILL LATER
096460005	HIS FATHER HAZARDED ONE GUESS
096460006	WHEN HE RETURNED HE ASKED IF THEY WERE HUNGRY
096460007	BEING WITHOUT YOU MAKES ME VERY UNHAPPY
096460008	THOSE EYES COULD STOP BULLETS
096460009	SHE ALWAYS MAKE THEM MAD
096460010	WHAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE THEN
096460011	WAS IT MOVING AS AN AUTOMOBILE
096460012	ONE FURTHER REMARK HOWEVER LEFT HIS LIPS
096460013	WE MUST GET BETTER ACQUAINTED
096460014	YOU ATTACKED US AFTER ALL
096460015	BUT SOMETIMES LIFE CAN HURT
096460016	CHAPTER ONE FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL

096460018	THIS PLACE IS BAD NEWS
096460019	WELL YOUR ABOUT HALF RIGHT
096460020	JUST WISHING EACH OTHER LUCK

096470003	A THIRD FINISHED WELL THERE YOU HAVE IT
096470004	THIS WAS LIKE STRIKING THEIR FLAG
096470005	BOTH GIRLS CALLED OUT AS THEY WATCHED HER LEAVE
096470007	WERE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE EVIL
096470008	YOU CAN JUMP WITHOUT ME
096470010	IF THAT EVER HAPPENS THAT IS
096470011	NOTHING BUT AN IMMENSE SEA
096470012	THEY WERE PROBABLY DATING OR SOMETHING HE SHRUGGED

096470018	ANYWAY THANKS FOR YOUR HELP
096470019	MY FATHER'S VOICE SOUNDED TENSE
096470020	MAYBE WE SHOULD GET SOME CAKE
096470021	MORE THAN USUAL AT ANY RATE
096470022	HER MIND STARTED FORGETTING EVERYTHING
096470023	HIS HEAD HURT EVEN WORSE
096490001	WAS I IN A HOSPITAL OR SOMETHING
096490002	HE LOOKED AROUND THE HOTEL RESTAURANT
096490003	BEST TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANTED
096490004	NOTHING SHOWED THAT ANYTHING HAD OCCURRED
096490005	SHE WHISPERED ANGRY AT HER LOSS OF CONTROL
096490006	YOU CAN SLEEP HERE TONIGHT
096490007	THEY CLEARLY HAVE EVERYTHING THOUGHT THROUGH
096490008	A BROKEN LAND SITTING ON BROKEN GROUND
096490009	ONCE AGAIN HE HOPED IT WOULD LAST
096490010	NO SUCH THING AS TRUST
096490011	HER THIN WHITE FINGERS WERE GRIPPING ITS SIDES
096490012	IMAGINE TEN TIMES MORE DIRT
096490013	IN THIS MOMENT SHE IS HAPPY
096490014	WE KNOW WHERE YOU RUN
096490015	THINGS ARE MOVING ALONG SO FAST
096490016	THROUGH HEARING ONLY HIS VOICE
096490017	TWO BULLETS SHOT BUT MISSED
096490018	IT ALL ENDS TOO SOON
096490019	WHY LEAVE ME PLEASE TELL ME
096490020	IT'S NOT FIRST PERSON NOW
